<p>You, tuning your tambura,<br>
pause to tell me<br>
how long ago, at home<br>
your grandfather would rouse you<br>
to learn the night-time ragas, while your sister <br>
slept, and the water-buffalo<br>
stirred, chewed its cud, and slept, the stars <br>
fading, your voice<br>
finding the colors of night:</p>
<p><em>Hillola, </em>sung at midnight,<br>
&quot;a fawn-like woman moving slowly&quot;;<br>
<em>Kausika, </em>&quot;perfumed with saffron&quot;, and <em>Lalita </em><br>
&quot;rising from her bed to greet the dawn&quot;. <br>
Above the drone of his tambura<br>
your grandfather made you sing them<br>
again and again. If not sung well, he told you, <br>
ragas and their raginis suffer<br>
like injured men and women.</p>
<p>You learned to live by rhythms<br>
more intricate than blood and breath mark out. But time <br>
caught up with you. Your sister<br>
married for love. Your husband chose you<br>
whose name means <em>beautiful, </em>for music.<br>
Yet when you rise at night<br>
it is to calm a child, or set<br>
the lentils soaking.</p>
<p>But sometimes you take down<br>
your grandfather's tambura from the shelf<br>
and tune the jangled strings. The polished gourd-shape <br>
still gleams, the ivory vine<br>
still twines unbroken round the neck.<br>
Then, kneeling barefoot on the floor,<br>
veiled by your hair,<br>
you summon up those august presences<br>
the ragas.</p>
