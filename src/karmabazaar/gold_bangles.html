<p>It is twelve years since I first put on <br>
these bangles. Circles<br>
of yellow Indian gold,<br>
they bruised the bones of my hand <br>
as I pulled them on.<br>
I sleep in them: my husband<br>
can tell my mood<br>
from the sound of my bangles <br>
in the dark.</p>
<p>No ornaments, they are <br>
like hair or fingernails part <br>
of my body.<br>
One has a raised design <br>
or spell. The other<br>
is plain, and dented <br>
by my children's teeth.</p>
<p>Daughter, on your wedding day<br>
I will put golden bangles <br>
on your wrists. Gold<br>
to keep you from want <br>
in strangers' houses, and<br>
for beauty: lying down naked <br>
as on the night you were born,<br>
you shall wear upon your dark skin <br>
gold from this distant country <br>
of your birth.</p>
