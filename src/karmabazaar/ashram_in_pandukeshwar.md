<p><em>We have gone as far into the mountains </em><br>
<em>as we can. Here the road</em><br>
<em>becomes a snow-swept track</em><br>
<em>that leads to Tibet or China or nowhere. </em><br>
<em>The small ramshackle town</em><br>
<em>is perched on a frontier</em><br>
<em>beyond which lies perpetual winter: </em><br>
<em>heaped-up drifts</em><br>
<em>marked only by the occasional prints</em><br>
<em>of snow-leopard or the great Himalayan condor.</em><br>
<em>This is the remotest place of pilgrimage. </em><br>
<em>Those who go further</em><br>
<em>go on some private errand and go alone.</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	
<li>We sat in the bus, my friend and I, <br>
hurled through the mountains. Behind us <br>
lay Badrinath, its mineral spring <br>
and ancient idol; the town, tawdry <br>
and sacred, receding to a spatter of roofs <br>
against gray rock.
<p>We were the only foreigners<br>
among hill people: women<br>
in velveteen and turquoise, spangled caps, <br>
babies stiff in padded jackets.<br>
One woman wept<br>
for a girl left at the bus stop<br>
with her new husband and his chattering sisters. <br>
Others, seeing we were strangers,<br>
leaned across to point out waterfalls,<br>
rockslides, a green glimpse<br>
of the Alakhananda River, deep<br>
in its jagged gorge,<br>
rushing toward confluence with the Ganges:</p>
<p>Mother Ganga, here a young, violent stream<br>
falling from heaven to earth<br>
in such a rapture of white water<br>
that the god Shiva has to break her force,<br>
catching her in his hair<br>
in springs and fountains, <br>
freshets, brooks, tributaries.</p>
<p>We jolted to a stop<br>
beside a roadside shrine. Wind gusted<br>
through stunted pines, rocking the bus. The priest <br>
ran out, we crowded to the windows<br>
to offer a few coins to the monkey god<br>
and have our foreheads smeared<br>
with thick vermilion. <br>
The little temple,<br>
carved and painted in yellow, blue and pink, <br>
leaned crazily, as though about to hurl itself<br>
off of its precipice.<br>
Blessed, we careened on down the mountain.</p>
</li>

<li>Though we bathed in the spring<br>
and visited the god<br>
we had not gone as pilgrims.<br>
Summer travelers<br>
we went wherever trains and buses took us, <br>
vaguely following the Ganges.<br>
&ldquo;Many monkeys in Benares&rdquo; <br>
you telegraphed home.<br>
Lost in a flood of worshippers<br>
we haunted the river, barefoot<br>
on silty temple floors,<br>
and fed whole garlands to the ribby cows <br>
that mooned among the shrines. The hems <br>
of our clothes were always damp<br>
with the lap and splash of the river.
<p>Nights, in our crumbling room<br>
at Aces New Deal Hotel<br>
we spread out treasures: tridents<br>
on red silk cords, brass pots of Ganges water <br>
sealed with wax, squares<br>
of blue and orange cotton, printed<br>
with the sacred syllable OM.<br>
I said, <em>would pilgrims </em><br>
<em>spend so much time in trinket stalls?</em></p>
<p>Shorn-headed widows<br>
wrapped in dirty white<br>
crouched on the river-stairs, held out<br>
tin cups for alms.<br>
their cheerfulness unnerved you.<br>
<em>Why is there suffering, </em>you had asked,<br>
would have asked any holy man or beggar <br>
except that the fingerless, outstretched hand, <br>
the ritual gleam of mutilation<br>
defied your question.<br>
<em style="margin-left:120px;">Stranger,</em></p>
<p style="display:block;float:right;text-align:center;"><em>the riddle we ask<br>
beyond the threshold<br>
staring from masks of flesh<br>
veil upon veil<br>
and underneath<br>
there are no words<br>
for what the third eye sees<br>
they are drowning<br>
the images in<br>
the river the riddle<br>
what is the question<br>
to this answer: yes</em></p>

<p>At night, in the streets<br>
actors performed the <em>Ramayana: </em><br>
bright scraps of silk, horse-hair wigs, <br>
love's epic gestures.</p>
<p>By day<br>
the goddess inhabited<br>
a painted plaster body,<br>
and god was a smooth stone <br>
brought garlanded to the temple <br>
and offered water.</p>

<p>Do you remember<br>
the temple in Rishikesh? Stunned by light <br>
we had gone inside to rest in the shade,<br>
and entered a dimness down whose basalt steps <br>
a waterfall of sound dropped, swirled<br>
and vanished: solitary raga<br>
of the young temple priest alone with the god.</p>
<p>He plucked the strings of his tambura<br>
and a vibration filled the void<br>
as though the void were humming to itself. <br>
We had overheard a song<br>
not meant for us. Silently picking up our sandals <br>
we left.</p>
<p>Though we hesitated by the river, <br>
we had a promise to keep. <br>
&ldquo;Should you reach Badrinath,&rdquo; <br>
our friend had said,<br>
&ldquo;I want to send a gift<br>
to someone in a nearby village,&rdquo; <br>
and wrote, the Hindi letters <br>
gracefully pendant as ripe fruit, <br>
<em>Honoured Swamiji: </em>my <em>American friends </em><br>
<em>are on vacation in the mountains. </em><br>
<em>They bring one hundred rupees </em><br>
<em>for the ashram, and greetings</em><br>
<em>from the grandson of your teacher, Ragunath.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we find him?&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Ask in Badrinath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And everyone to whom we showed the letter <br>
added a message on the envelope.<br>
<em>Maharaj! Here are</em><br>
<em>some foreigners inquiring for you.</em></p>
<p><em>Revered Guruji, your servant Kumar </em><br>
<em>respectfully wishes you to know </em><br>
<em>all is well now with his wife.</em></p>
<p>Each time, we had to tell the story<br>
as our friend told it us,<br>
until the words fell smooth as river-pebbles, <br>
exemplary as an old mosaic<br>
on a temple floor.</p></li>
<li>
In a fever-stricken year<br>
Ragunath lost his young wife in childbirth, <br>
left his family<br>
and went to live in Rishikesh<br>
at the foot of the Himalayas.<br>
There he fasted and prayed<br>
until pilgrims, coming daily with their gifts of food <br>
and their garlands and pious questionings, <br>
distracted him from God.
<p>He moved into the mountains,<br>
climbing the donkey track<br>
that edged the terraced, stony farms<br>
guarded by dogs. Hill families,<br>
driving their water buffalo to high pastures, <br>
stood aside to let him pass: gaunt wanderer, <br>
saffron-clad, black-bearded, long hair<br>
knotted at the nape; followed<br>
by his disciple, a young boy<br>
with the high cheek bones and black, tilted eyes <br>
of the mountain people.</p>
<p>When they reached Pandukeshwar,<br>
a village so hidden in cloud<br>
that only the hardiest pilgrims, persevering<br>
from fabled Badrinath, would find it,<br>
they stopped. The village priest<br>
had died, the temple<br>
stood locked, the images neglected.<br>
And Ragunath stayed,<br>
lured out the monkeys from the shrine,<br>
brought wildflowers for the gods.</p>
<p>Below the village, the wild Alakhananda <br>
dropped roaring from the mountains. <br>
Here Ragunath built his ashram:<br>
neat whitewashed hermitage,<br>
paved courtyard,<br>
a carved balcony. Two cells for sleeping,<br>
and a large empty room<br>
where pilgrims could put down their bedroll; <br>
and opposite, a shrine to house the god.</p>
<p>He planted peas and marigolds<br>
and apple saplings in the stony soil.</p>
<p>Then Ragunath wrote home:<br>
<em>Let the boy come to me.</em><br>
And so his son was brought<br>
in a procession of donkeys up the mountain, <br>
blessed, and sent home again,<br>
too young and bewildered to remember <br>
his only meeting with his father.</p>
<p>The boy grew up to marry <br>
and have a son.</p>
<p>Sometimes a wandering sadhu<br>
would bring news of the ashram: a paved road <br>
now led past. More disciples<br>
had come, Ragunath being famous<br>
for his austerities and the grace<br>
that flowed from them.</p>

<p style="text-indent:120px;">In his hundredth year<br>
he sent a letter to his family: <em>Great changes </em><br>
<em>will come upon India.</em><br>
<em>I shall not stay to see them.</em><br>
He called his followers to him,<br>
blessed them, and gave the ashram<br>
into the keeping of his first disciple.<br>
Then he went deep into the mountains.</p></li>
<li>The gods of Pandukeshwar <br>
rule their kingdom

<p>beneath the mountain.<br>
Queen Sita robed in cobalt blue,

<p>King Rama in a scarlet cloak<br>
hold out their hands to golden Hanuman</p>

<p>the hero monkey.<br>
Their altar drips with garlands</p>

<p>fresh-woven daily.<br>
How pale we look beside the gods,</p>

<p>how sparrow-drab the village children <br>
twirling bare toes in the dust.</p>

<p>But where is Swamiji, master <br>
of images? Whispers,</p>

<p>shy, sidelong smiles, <br>
a sudden flight.</p>

<p>We sit down in the tea stall by the road <br>
with its enormous clay stove fed with twigs</p>

<p>and watch food cooking. <br>
Hammered brass pots</p>

<p>hold lentils, chili, rice. <br>
Bread fries on the open fire,</p>
<p>sweet tea steams in clay cups<br>
made to be drunk from once and broken.</p>

<p>We eat and drink<br>
watched by mountain men in leaf&ndash;</p>

<p>green leggings and peaked caps <br>
throwing dice beside the road.</p>

<p><em>What if the ashram is gone?</em><br>
<em>What if no bus ever comes here again?</em></p>

<p><em>Will a woodcutter appear</em><br>
<em>to lead us through the forest</em></p>

<p><em>past slopes of birch and twisted spruce<br>
where bharal sheep dig through the crusted snow</em></p>

<p><em>with hoofs as black and brittle as obsidian? </em><br>
<em>If we climb far enough</em></p>

<p><em>we'll come to Ragunath in his high cave: <br>
wind-hollowed, his body worn luminous as old silver.</em></p>

<p><em>The last stretch of the pilgrimage </em><br>
<em>is the hardest</em></p>

<p><em>inching along the rough track cut in the cliff, </em><br>
<em>waylaid at hairpin turns by the gods</em></p>

<p><em>in dizzying veils of light </em><br>
<em>or necklaces of skulls;</em></p>

<p><em>the whispers of the dead </em><br>
<em>hissing like wind in our ears.</em></p>

<p><em>One who returned from the journey </em><br>
<em>told me this:</em></p>

<p><em>lifting the cup from the well of life to his lips </em><br>
<em>he found the water turned to emerald ice.</em></p>
<p>The cook's apprentice<br>
lies curled on a heap of rags</p>
<p>gazing down into the river. Dazzled <br>
by the water's swirl, my eyes</p>

<p>begin to close, when <em>Swamiji, </em><br>
<em>Swamiji! </em>The children tug our hands.</p>
<p>They bring us to a small room in the temple <br>
where he sits, Ragunath's disciple,</p>

<p>before a brassbound book.<br>
Beside him on the bare stone floor</p>
<p>a wicker basket glows with marigolds. <br>
Then his disciple, cross-legged on the floor,</p>

<p>opens the letter, reads aloud<br>
the words of his old guru's grandson.</p>
<p>Gold light of noon falls on the images, <br>
the flowers, Swamiji's face.</p>
</li>

<li>Wrapped in shawls against the mountain cold <br>
we sat on the ashram wall<br>
shelling peas. Apple trees spread laden branches <br>
over us. Behind us the river<br>
tumbled boulders down the gorge,<br>
but here was composure and stillness, the small <br>
chores of afternoon. Outside the kitchen, <br>
the serving woman cleaned the rice for supper, <br>
ground cinnamon and cloves<br>
to honor our visit.

<p>Swamiji's disciple<br>
came with gifts: apples, two yellow roses,<br>
roast ears of corn. And a herd of small calves <br>
clattered down from their stony pasture,<br>
butting each other<br>
for pea pods and corn cobs <br>
and last night's buttermilk.</p>

<p>Then our guide led us up the river<br>
to a wild garden of cosmos and roses, <br>
overgrown, shadowy, the flowers <br>
escaping to the river, or twined<br>
with trumpetflower vines around the door<br>
of a stone hermitage.<br>
Barefoot<br>
we entered: fumes of incense, <br>
and a man sitting in meditation<br>
wearing only a rosary<br>
of seeds and silver, and his tangled hair. <br>
He looked up. His smile<br>
went through us like a spear.</p>

<p>Then, with eyes newly opened<br>
we saw, along the bank,<br>
dwellings of other hermits,<br>
one cut into the cliff, one, woven<br>
of leafy branches, perched<br>
above the overhang;<br>
and so on up the stream, the cells<br>
blending with rocks and trees and blossoms.</p>

<p>How long we stayed<br>
in that shape-shifting space beside the river<br>
I never afterwards could tell;<br>
only that when at last we sighed<br>
and rose to go<br>
the sun was dropping toward the mountains<br>
and the stream's light was quenched. We turned, <br>
and airy wards and tumblers fell<br>
behind us into place.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p style="text-align:center;float:right;display:block"><em>Going down going into<br>
the deepest part of the cave<br>
darkness no lips need move<br>
in this place<br>
that is all breath<br>
who speaks who<br>
<br>
listens<br>
<br>
who is the one who sees<br>
without light<br>
suddenly in the cave<br>
vertigo of stars<br>
a whirling center<br>
<br>
into which everything</em>
</p>

<p>When we returned <br>
to the compound<br>
there was nothing to do <br>
but look at the river, <br>
a river that was now <br>
only a mountain stream, <br>
cold and deep.<br><br><br></p>

<p>We hardly spoke.<br>
It was starting to get dark <br>
and the serving woman <br>
was filling oil lamps <br>
against the coming night.</p>
</li>

<li style="clear:both;"><strong>Swamiji's Tale</strong>
<p>There is an ancient grove, its fringes touching <br>
The edges of the world. Here came one day <br>
Sage Vishvamitra, weary from long preaching,</p>

<p>To fast, and meditate on life, and pray.<br>
Shaded by awnings, curtains of green leaves,<br>
For years he watched the shadows' dappled play,</p>

<p>Quicksilver beauty that deceives<br>
The ignorant heart. He knew it for the veil <br>
Of Vishnu's Maya, loveliest disguise</p>

<p>Of the forever hidden Imperishable.<br>
But as he watched, straining to look beyond, <br>
He saw the tiniest worm, almost invisible,</p>

<p>Eating a pinprick hole in a green frond. <br>
&ldquo;What are you doing to my tree?&rdquo; he said, <br>
Voice creaky from disuse. &ldquo;0 friend,</p>

<p>It took a century&rdquo; the worm replied<br>
&ldquo;To eat this least part of a single leaf <br>
Among the billion billion leaves that shade</p>

<p>The ground you sit on. But this age-old grove <br>
Will see the day when the last bite<br>
Of the last leaf is taken. Then the breath</p>

<p>Of Brahma ends. A starless night<br>
Will swallow time, the gods, and everything.&ldquo; <br>
And Vishvamitra, &ldquo;how could one worm blight</p>

<p>A grove vast as the universe?&rdquo; So saying, <br>
He fell asleep. It seemed to him he dreamed <br>
Lifetimes: Brahmin, untouchable and king,</p>

<p>Serpent, ox, butterfly, a clod of loam.<br>
But when he woke he saw a curious thing: <br>
How bright was his green home</p>

<p>With more than half its foliage gone, <br>
Stripped to the skeleton<br>
Through which the sunlight shone.</p>
</li>

<li>In the pilgrims' hall<br>
the oil lamp threw flittering shadows <br>
as we ate our evening meal.<br>
Swamiji told old tales<br>
to entertain us, and brought<br>
a picture of his teacher Ragunath<br>
seated among mountains: one hand raised <br>
in blessing or farewell.<br>
In portraits<br>
all holy men look alike. Polite, mistaken, <br>
we admired the painting.
<p>After eating, we walked, shivering, <br>
to wash in the spring. The air<br>
smelled of spices and evergreens, distant snowfields. <br>
Dark, watchful peaks<br>
Nilkanth, Kedarnath, Bandar Poonch <br>
stooped over us, shutting out<br>
the last light.<br>
Then we slept<br>
on thick wool blankets on the floor, <br>
blankets so black and rough<br>
we thought they must be knit of yak hair.</p>
<p>A brazen clangor tore us out of sleep: <br>
The temple gong<br>
waking the god, and Swamiji,<br>
a shadow in the inner shrine,<br>
passing the oil lamp back and forth<br>
before the staring image. His disciple<br>
circled the temple, chanting.<br></p>

<p style="text-indent:120px;">A full moon<br>
spilled its silver on him, on the temple,<br>
the river, and the near, snow-covered mountains.</p>
<p>We crouched in the doorway,<br>
shawls covering our heads, as though our journey <br>
had been for this only, to complete<br>
a necessary task: neither inside nor out<br>
but on the threshold,<br>
held by the old, charged syllables,<br>
the great, dark lemur-eyes<br>
of god, the ancient masque.</p>
<p>The disciple touched his forehead to the ground. <br>
Swamiji, beckoning,<br>
filled our cupped hands with marigolds, <br>
then drew a screen<br>
between the god and us.</p>
<p>The lamp in our room<br>
had burned out. We lay in dense blackness, <br>
shutters closed against marauding monkeys, <br>
talking softly of the day, of Ragunath<br>
and Swamiji, the ashram.<br>
My friend said &ldquo;and the watcher by the river...&rdquo; <br>
and I, &ldquo;no, shh...&rdquo;<br>
and the voice of the Alakhananda<br>
flowed through us<br>
like the ceaseless chanting of mantras.</p>
</li>

<li>In the night garden <br>
a man keeps watch.
<p>He is telling the story of my life<br>
in a tongue I cannot understand;<br>
tongues of moonlight<br>
from the river to his face, light<br>
on the mountain,<br>
marigolds like heaped-up flames <br>
in the dark hut.</p>
<p>As I bend<br>
to dip water in a jar<br>
a ring slips from my frozen hand<br>
into the icy Alakhananda<br>
flowing through the tangled hair of God. <br>
The mountain shivers. He is dancing<br>
on his dark dancing-ground, <em>Chidambaram.</em><br>
His drum beats like my heart.</p>
<p>But my friend<br>
has turned into the seeker Gargi<br>
from Swamiji's brassbound book.<br>
A most persistent questioner,<br>
she has been talking for two thousand years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Sir, since all this world is woven, warp and woof, on water,<br>
on what is water woven, warp and woof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On wind, 0 Gargi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what then, please, is the wind woven, warp and woof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the moon, 0 Gargi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but on what is the moon woven, warp and woof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the worlds of the gods, 0 Gargi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worlds of the gods,<br>
across what are they woven, warp and woof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Gargi, they are woven <br>
on that which people call<br>
the present, past and future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, that which people call<br>
the present, past and future&ndash;<br>
across what is it woven, warp and woof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is woven across the void, 0 Gargi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Sir, across what &ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as I listen, the river-murmur swells,<br>
drowns out all speech except its own. <br>
My ring, circle of jasper, turns<br>
and turns in the green warp of water woven<br>
on wind and moonlight, loom <br>
of dream.</p>
</li>

<li>We rose to chanting<br>
as dawn warmed the mountains.<br>
The serving woman brought brass tumblers <br>
of steaming, nutmeg-flavored tea<br>
where we sat with the old brindled watchdog <br>
outside the courtyard.
<p>There is a woman, Swamiji told us, <br>
who comes for a time each year <br>
to live like a nun in the ashram, <br>
her mind fixed on the imperishable <br>
across which the void is stretched.</p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;">Will she at last<br>
leave even here,<br>
and go like Ragunath into the Himalayas?</p>
<p>It was time<br>
for us to take the stony river-road<br>
to Pandukeshwar Village and the bus stop.<br>
Children ran beside us, from small farms<br>
people hailed Swamiji &ndash; <em>Maharaj! Maharaj!</em></p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;">Abruptly<br>
the bus came swerving down the mountain, full<br>
to overflowing.</p>
<p style="text-indent:120px;">We had imagined<br>
that in farewell we might, like pilgrims, <br>
bend low and touch his feet.<br>
Instead, our last memory was laughter, <br>
and his hands pushing us<br>
into the crowded bus.</p>
<p>And the ashram, our gift <br>
for one day, receded,<br>
a white speck in a photograph of mountains:<br>
where we, bleached in the great light<br>
and holding marigolds<br>
stand timelessly beside the Alakhananda, <br>
thumbprints like blood <br>
staining our foreheads.</p>
</li>
</ol>
