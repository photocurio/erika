<p style="padding-left:120px;"><em>At the end of the nine-day Durga </em><br>
<em>Festival in Benares, the images, </em><br>
<em>from whom the goddess has </em><br>
<em>departed, are thrown into the </em><br>
<em>sacred River Ganges.</em></p>
<p>The Goddess Durga<br>
rides through the city, spear poised <br>
at the demon's heart.<br>
Tumblers, dancers, </p>
<p>flutes and drums<br>
bring down to the river<br>
the life-sized idols in their glittering robes, <br>
jewels at wrist and throat.</p>
<p>Boats wait, ringed<br>
with lights, to row<br>
the images into deep water.<br>
From silt-washed stairs<br>
children send paper rafts with lighted candles <br>
bobbing and whirling down the stream.</p>
<p>We crowd into a heavy, black-prowed boat <br>
with other watchers. But the boatman <br>
nudges the craft<br>
away from the throng, the images,<br>
the wailing flutes,<br>
past shadowy ghats, ashen remains of pyres, <br>
past crumbling walls with pillared balconies <br>
that once housed rajahs.</p>
<p>The Ganges widens, swift<br>
and black. The oarsman<br>
rows hard against the current,<br>
and drops of sacred water splash our hands. <br>
We wipe them, secretly, against our clothes.</p>
<p>A dark, lop-sided rowboat<br>
crosses our bow,<br>
makes for the opposite shore with muffled strokes. <br>
Inside, drenched glistening skirts,<br>
a bangle-circled arm, a drowned thing<br>
lies across the thwarts.<br>
Salvage, theft, ritual,<br>
the oarsman hooded in darkness<br>
gives no sign. Our fellow passengers<br>
seem not to see.<br>
And no one speaks.</p>
<p>Our boatman turns, we drift,<br>
the river taking us,<br>
and we, my friend and I,<br>
fall fast asleep and have to be awakened <br>
when it is time to pay<br>
and go ashore.</p>
<p>The crowd<br>
is denser than before, the night more frantic. <br>
Jostled and pushed along the road <br>
we talk uneasily<br>
of what we were not shown<br>
and what we were. The moon<br>
cuts from each boat a wavering shadow, <br>
and still the images<br>
come to be drowned.</p>
