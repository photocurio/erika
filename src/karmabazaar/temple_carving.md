<p>From crooked gutters<br>
where huts of tin and sacking<br>
lean against each other like tired children <br>
incense rises up to Lakshmi.<br>
Her name is smooth as almond oil <br>
on tongues parched<br>
for water,<br>
that whisper without hope<br>
<em>I wish, I wish.</em></p>
<p>Lakshmi is floating<br>
in a disarray of lotus petals<br>
on the Eternal Sea. Lord Vishnu<br>
has cupped his hand<br>
around her naked breast,<br>
her jasmine-scented fingers trace<br>
the outline of his thigh. Ten centuries <br>
will pass before she sinks back, satisfied, <br>
and, breathing in the incense, murmurs<br>
<em>granted.</em></p>
