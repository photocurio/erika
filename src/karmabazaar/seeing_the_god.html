<p>At the temple door<br>
we pause. An old man beckons:<br>
<em>Come, sisters, come. The god is great. </em><br>
Canopied in gold, the inner shrine <br>
glitters with gems and silver, dazzles us <br>
as we search<br>
for the black basalt image.</p>
<p>The pilgrims' guidebook says <br>
whoever sees Lord Badrinath, <br>
from his diadem to his holy feet, <br>
will gain release from life and death. <br>
We can't decide<br>
if what we see in the distance is the god<br>
or only a dark, accidental<br>
gap between lamps, garlands, <br>
cloth of gold.</p>
<p>We never asked<br>
release from birth and death,<br>
but only that the world should come to us <br>
again and again; that we<br>
try on the masks of men and animals, <br>
of pilgrims, wizards, whores,<br>
of <em>crows </em>and dolphins.<br>
The old man whispers, <em>say</em><br>
<em>the god is great.</em></p>
<p>We join our palms,<br>
offer some coins and flowers, turn <br>
to go. Outside,<br>
the marble bull of the god Shiva kneels, <br>
his testicles smeared with saffron<br>
by pious wives. And from a niche in the wall <br>
a blood-red face<br>
with river-pebble eyes and a slit mouth <br>
smiles,<br>
sacred, terrible.</p>
