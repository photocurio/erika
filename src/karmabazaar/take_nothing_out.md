<p>From the edge of Bhuleshwar <br>
where even the gods<br>
lose themselves<br>
we looked back.<br>
But the scent of jasmine<br>
beckoned us from Phulgal, <br>
Lane of Flowers, and the alleys <br>
swallowed us.</p>
<p>A web of streets led<br>
to courtyards within courtyards, overhung <br>
by wooden balconies<br>
where laundry fluttered. Cows<br>
brushed past tiny stalls, heaped<br>
with eggplants. Bangle sellers<br>
held out fragile wares, and pilgrims, <br>
leaning on their staffs, watched us<br>
through the doors of painted temples.</p>
<p><em>We </em>refused no one,<br>
we gave alms to beggars, and bargained <br>
for curious purchases: apples of Sita, <br>
a red clay water pot,<br>
a sieve, an iron saucer<br>
for frying seeds.<br>
A grinning old woman<br>
sold us flesh-colored fingers of turmeric <br>
and a bunch of channa peas, torn up <br>
by the roots.</p>
<p>Clutching these talismans, the apple <br>
sweet in our mouths,<br>
we found the way out of Bhuleshwar. <br>
But the things I brought from there <br>
refused to thrive. The clay pot leaked,<br>
the sieve held water. I spat out<br>
bitter mouthfuls of turmeric,<br>
and the channa, fried in my saucer, tasted <br>
of burnt hair.</p>
<p>People go there for bargains: wedding <br>
flowers, peas and beans, food<br>
for the dead. Next time<br>
in the lanes of Bhuleshwar,<br>
I will braid my hair with jasmine <br>
and feed channa<br>
to the silent cows. The old woman <br>
watching me will see<br>
I take nothing out.</p>
