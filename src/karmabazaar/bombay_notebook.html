<p>We step from the plane into tropical night. <br>
The smell - of what? Spice, urine, incense, <br>
Smoke - is a presence, harsh as the sight</p>
<p>Of shrouded, sleeping forms: essence <br>
At first, of Bombay. For weeks I am ill <br>
With fever, nausea, a piercing sense</p>
<p>Of exile. What had I thought to feel <br>
For the ragpicker, the lame<br>
Woman whose fingerless hands hold</p>
<p>A large-headed, silent baby? Ashamed, <br>
I empty my purse. <em>Don't touch me, </em><br>
<em>Don't make me look. </em>It's I who's maimed.</p>
<p>Househunting, the first flat we see<br>
Is full of crows, preening their glistening rags <br>
On the rosewood screen and damask settee.</p>
<p>We find an apartment and the weather changes. <br>
My vision clears. In the monsoon-rinsed air <br>
The bitter scent's of home. The leper who drags</p>
<p>Smiling, after me, lives next door <br>
In Gitanagar &quot;The Place of Song&quot; <br>
Patched of sacking and tin and paper,</p>
<p>And she and I begin a long<br>
Wordless acquaintance. My friend Sundari <br>
Lends me a rough black grinding stone.</p>
<p>We engage a teacher of Hindi.<br>
And as I struggle to form the letters<br>
Or to hear four indistinguishable sounds of <em>d</em></p>
<p>I think how nothing in my alphabet<br>
Has prepared me to say<br>
The thousand names of Brahma, or to write,</p>
<p>Correctly, &quot;naked, the pilgrim goes his way.&quot;</p>
