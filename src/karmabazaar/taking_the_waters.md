<p>The bus that takes away <br>
the morning's fish<br>
brings the old women.</p>
<p>Tucking up green and purple saris<br>
they wade into the sea like iridescent fish-crows <br>
and settle themselves in the foam.</p>
<p>Black-eyed granddaughters<br>
pour water over them from brass jars <br>
to cool the brain,</p>
<p>while they cackle and splash, <br>
plan weddings, cremations, <br>
lyings-in, among the waves.</p>
<p>Sand shifts, and tickles<br>
their haunches. Minnows<br>
wriggle into their saris as into seaweed.</p>
<p>Riding home in the bus,<br>
wrapped in streaming grey hair <br>
that smells of crab and iodine</p>
<p>they feel the sluggish blood<br>
pulse thinner, more wicked: ancient Aphrodites, <br>
licking salt from their thumbs.</p>
