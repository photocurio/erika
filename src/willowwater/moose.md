<p>People say they have seen them<br>
looming dim and immense, on snowy roads,<br>
or lifting mournful faces, bearded<br>
with waterweeds, from boggy clearings.<br>
Once a gnarled shape was glimpsed<br>
ploughing across the river,<br>
dwarfing the lobster boat in its wake: a moose <br>
returning to the swamp where it had browsed unseen <br>
for years, only its great hoofprints<br>
bearing witness.</p>
<p>The swamp lies on the blind side <br>
of the town with its<br>
T.V. antennas, pick-up trucks, <br>
frozen pizzas in the dusty grocery.<br>
Lobster boats named <em>Lucy D. </em>and <em>Mermaid</em><br>
work the traps, clammers fan out<br>
over mud flats at low tide, a chain saw <br>
whines and snarls in the woods.<br>
Between the graveyard and the dump <br>
the road doubles back and circles, <br>
skirting the swamp.<br></p>
<p>Truants play there, stained<br>
with blackberry juice,<br>
stung by deer flies. They wade out<br>
to pick waterlilies, the stems<br>
trailing slime,<br>
and their caps are stuck with nighthawk feathers <br>
speckled like dead leaves. Salamanders<br>
and liverworts soak their pockets, to wilt later <br>
in peanut butter jars.</p>
<p>Every snapping of twigs<br>
is a great beast approaching,<br>
but the moose, if there is one, <br>
makes itself invisible, a tangle <br>
of branches, a hump of earth.<br>
It ranges an unmapped landscape <br>
older than man's: paths into deeper <br>
more rooted forests, crossed <br>
seldom, by chance.</p>
