<p>The longest night of all, we lay <br>
On the warm sand beside the sea, <br>
Orion glittered overhead,<br>
We counted all the Pleiades.</p>
<p>A ghost crab brushed against my hair, <br>
The palm trees hissed in the warm wind. <br>
We sighed and moved apart. You said <br>
How near the planets were, how far <br>
The last, receding, coldest star.</p>
<p>Then the floor tilted under me.<br>
I stood against a wall of sand<br>
As in the doorway of the world.<br>
Around me streamed the gulfs of space. <br>
From star to star the light-years poured.</p>
<p>So loosely held in earth's embrace <br>
I shivered: centrifuge or grace,<br>
What casual tug of her huge hand<br>
Saves us from floating through that door.</p>
