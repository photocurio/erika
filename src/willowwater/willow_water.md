<p>Door-keeper, guardian<br>
of order in the library,<br>
often I meet him on his rounds, <br>
watching&mdash;for what?<br>
Jam smears and apple peelings? <br>
That no one's lost?</p>
<p>Trying to fend off a recurrent nausea <br>
I was smuggling tea into the stacks<br>
when we converged<br>
screened from each other by a potted tree <br>
with leaves like giants' hands.</p>
<p>I slid my cup behind a book, and asked <br>
(diverting his attention)<br>
the name of that unlikely, snake-trunked plant. <br>
And I remembered<br>
where I'd seen it last:</p>
<p>A blowy summer day,<br>
a railroad cutting in Virginia, poor red soil <br>
rampant with wildflowers, kudzu, thistles <br>
over my head. A burst<br>
of yellow star seeds, and this tree,<br>
enormous, alligator-green, eight-fingered palms <br>
outspread. I came from that ravine <br>
stippled with tiny burrs like lentils <br>
and clutching a bouquet of gaudy weeds.</p>
<p>The janitor gave me a Latin name <br>
and a small shoot<br>
he sliced off with his penknife. <br>
&quot;Keep it in water<br>
till it puts out roots.&quot;<br>
We looked up at the tree. Its leaves, <br>
I saw, were stained with black.</p>
<p>&quot;It has a kind of cancer&quot; he explained. <br>
&quot;I've fed it, pruned it back<br>
trying to save its strength&mdash;and look, <br>
it keeps on growing, sending out <br>
new leaves. It could live for years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long before the seedling roots?&quot;<br>
&quot;Might be a month or two.<br>
If nothing happens&mdash;you know where willows grow? <br>
Well, put some rotting willow twigs in water. <br>
Wait till it turns a peat-bog brown<br>
then pour the willow water<br>
on your sprout.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned and pressed the elevator button<br>
for &quot;basement&quot;. I saw him there<br>
among the roots, the hairy<br>
feeders, long blind taproots, blurred mycelium threads, <br>
untangling, freeing,<br>
cutting away dead growth;<br>
his fingers webbed with leaf mould,<br>
hands brimming with water.</p>
<p>I sipped my tea,<br>
felt in my pocket<br>
for the thrice daily chalk-white pill<br>
speckled with olive like a songbird's egg. <br>
I thought &quot;cytoxan, methetrexate,<br>
five-fluoro-uracil and<br>
willow water.<br>
We could live for years.&quot; And then went home <br>
to plant the small green scion.</p>
