<p style="text-align:right;padding-right:40px;"><em>&mdash;</em>for Steve on his 27th birthday</p>

<p>If you had hesitated<br>
I wouldn't have come.<br>
As it was<br>
I packed my faded flowered skirt, <br>
some blouses and a bathing suit <br>
and off we drove<br>
across the continent.</p>

<p>Each morning<br>
I'd bring you coffee<br>
while you lay under your red car, <br>
tuning it up.<br>
You loved its engine.</p>

<p>On the pebbly shore of Lake Erie we picnicked. <br>
Disturbing, a sea with no tides.<br>
I told you stories<br>
of when you were a baby.<br>
I laid out my childhood for you,<br>
and the lives of your grandparents.<br>
You talked of the Amazon,<br>
the jungle that spread its green flourishes in you.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Mississippi<br>
we ate catfish in a diner<br>
&mdash;fried puffs of air. The waitress<br>
pretended to think I was your date. She said <br>
she could listen all day to our accents. <br>
The father of rivers swirled and flowed <br>
and turned to myth before our eyes.</p>

<p>By the Platte River, you read Mark Twain to me, <br>
and in Nebraska<br>
I wept to see the covered wagon tracks<br>
still crossing the prairie.<br>
We drove through starry darkness in Wyoming<br>
across fragrant sagebrush plains.<br>
The little town we finally stopped in<br>
was black and shuttered from one end to the other, <br>
except for the cardboard hotel. For some reason <br>
we spent most of the night drinking whisky.</p>
<p>We reached Salt Lake City one sunset:<br>
a Turner sky, mountains and clouds on fire &mdash;<br>
tender azure going to rose, to gold,<br>
to lavender, and, as we passed, a state trooper <br>
handcuffing a hitchhiker.<br>
On the shore of the Great Salt Lake, <br>
sepulchre-white, huge boulders spelled out names: <br>
Lisa, Ruthie, Ann. We never found out <br>
the deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Approaching Reno, the landscape <br>
became sinister. Was it the casinos <br>
lining the only street of every town? <br>
The hotel where we lunched<br>
glittered and sparkled and rang with gambling. <br>
You lost a pocketful of quarters. <br>
There was no daylight anywhere.</p>
<p>At last, the Sierras.<br>
Would your little car<br>
make it up the mountains? We gazed, <br>
enthralled, at the side-routes for trucks <br>
whose brakes had failed.<br>
We imagined them going on forever, <br>
flying frictionless down the mountain.</p>
<p>After a week on the road<br>
we reached the coast and your college. <br>
I flew back in one day.<br>
Looking out the window, I saw<br>
we were crossing the Mississippi.<br>
I knew then how fast our lives go by.</p>
