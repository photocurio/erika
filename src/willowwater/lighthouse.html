<p>Red exclamation on the chart,<br>
body of light the black, gale-gathered wave <br>
crashes against.</p>
<p>Owls Head, Cape Porpoise,<br>
Pemaquid Neck, the Graves.<br>
Each speaks one phrase into the dark.</p>
<p><em>Blue spark each eighteen seconds;</em><br>
<em>a fixed, steady beam; continuous quick </em><br>
<em>amber flashing; isophase; occulting green &mdash;</em></p>
<p>luminous conversation, joined <br>
by the occasional blown ember <br>
of a low-flying plane.</p>
<p>A fishing boat's<br>
mute question answered: <em>here. </em><br>
And <em>home.</em></p>
<p>We navigate past unseen landfalls,<br>
invisible riprap strewn with humped, remembered shapes <br>
of sleeping seals.</p>
<p>Your hand is on the tiller. <em>Flash. </em><br>
Tense, I count to fourteen. <em>Flash. </em><br>
&ldquo;That's Isles of Shoals&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Once more the world's word can be trusted, <br>
a net flung on the fluid night, like stars. <br>
Don't think, now, of those other</p>
<p>steadfast watchers<br>
whose light, still somewhere pulsing into space, <br>
looked into the blank eye of their last storm</p>
<p>and on our chart is marked <em>extinguished.</em></p>
