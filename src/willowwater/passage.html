<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
<li>By this imagined light-washed rock, let's pause<br>
&mdash;I need to catch my breath and look about me: <br>
Green, icy river broadening toward the sea, <br>
Lichen-frilled granite, gleam of isinglass. <br>
Think of a mossy trail through spruce. The murmur <br>
Of finches in the boughs, the secret hiss <br>
Of sifting needles pierce the ruddy darkness <br>
Lit by calm, level sunbeams of&mdash;late summer? <br>
Our children's voices&mdash;tatters in the wind. <br>
Swift rush of wings, blurred feathers, clattering cry<br>
&mdash;A great blue heron beats into the sky. <br>
Love holds me speechless. Our hands clasp. And then<br>
&mdash;No warning tremor, my heart skips no beat&mdash;<br>
Just the ground slowly opening at our feet.</p></li>
<li>Arms taped to what feels oddly like a cross, <br>
Green rubberized curtain severing my head <br>
From my prone body (to prevent the spread <br>
Of germs, I'm told): a wildly cheerful nurse<br>
Gives me the highlights&mdash;&quot;There! He's cut the last <br>
Layer. The cyst's exposed, and now he's taking . . <br>
Dear, are you all right?&quot; My arm is shaking. <br>
An intimate scooping, fibrous tearing, vast <br>
Pressure. Mauled alive yet without pain <br>
My body seems a table sharply set<br>
With cutlery the surgeon leans to get.<br>
<em>For God's sake take your elbow from my groin. </em><br>
A fly-wheel in my brain&mdash;repeat, stop, start: <br>
<em>0 Jewel hidden in the lotus's heart.</em></p></li>
<li>I note that you and I are wearing gray.<br>
Why this unease at the red beads that brighten <br>
My somber dress? I feel the bandage tighten. <br>
The surgeon strides in from Pathology. <br>
He sits. We sit. I read his face like braille. <br>
&quot;You've&mdash;a malignancy.&quot; Is his voice kind?<br>
The huge word blots all meaning from my mind. <br>
You grasp my arm. He fumbles with a pill. <br>
&quot;Now if the incision gives you any pain&quot; <br>
&mdash;Transfixed with terror, marvelling I hear <br>
&quot;Take this at bedtime. Keep the stitches clean.&quot; <br>
Your eyes&mdash;a look I've never seen before&mdash;<br>
Still, still I do not howl and bite the ground <br>
But take the mild placebo from his hand.</p></li>
<li>The restaurant is mercifully dim.<br>
I settle in a booth to wait for you.<br>
Beside me a plump file, stuffed to the brim, <br>
Holds biopsy slides, mammogram, x-ray<br>
We're taking to the ritual Second Opinion.<br>
Is there an honor system that prevents<br>
My peeking? Hurriedly I strew the contents <br>
Across the soup and rolls: my skeleton<br>
And my left breast, some random foot bones, skull. <br>
And here's my surgeon's crisply worded note, <br>
Blurred letters that detach, dissolve and float. <br>
What was the question? Force it to stand still. <br>
How bad is bad? One sentence yields the answer. <br>
He guesses stage two metastatic cancer.</p></li>
<li>As steadily as the rain falls, I weep.<br>
The windshield wipers make an arc of clarity, <br>
A sodden kleenex serves me. The disparity <br>
Between my anguish and the date I keep <br>
Is almost laughable. I've an appointment <br>
To choose upholstery for the living room. <br>
Flowers or stripes to drape the edge of doom? <br>
I'm lost. It rains. I weep. Oh for an ointment<br>
To soothe my aching eyes, my raw, scraped soul. <br>
What use our cozy, brightly furnished house <br>
Without me? My tears fall. Some comic muse <br>
Is saying &quot;Cheer up, we're all terminal.&quot; <br>
I stop the car and knuckle my eyes dry, <br>
Then put my head down on the wheel, and cry.</p></li>
<li>You called me brave. Brave? Let me tell my thought: <br>
What's happened is not worst, my deepest dread <br>
&mdash;Old superstitious bargains made with fate&mdash;<br>
Senile unlife or a child crippled, dead.<br>
I even thought&mdash;how could I live, endure<br>
The loss of love, that brilliant star withdrawn <br>
That lit a magic path out of my bare-<br>
Bones hermitage into the world? And then<br>
My mind reeled back&mdash;such cowardly courage, such <br>
Fearful bravery, slavish to preserve<br>
Treasure I'd rather perish than have touched! <br>
Do I hold life so cheap? Then I deserve<br>
Never to see the elm buds any more<br>
Nor feel the wind filling our sails offshore.</p></li>
<li>Received: one breast, with skin and nipple, fresh, <br>
Some twenty lymph nodes and a pad of fat <br>
By the pathology lab. A pound of flesh? <br>
They'll culture it, and then&mdash;and after that? <br>
Try not to see, oh try to cauterize<br>
The image in the shadows of the mind:<br>
My breast, blue-vein'd, that yielded to your hand; <br>
Stack belching tainted smoke into the skies.<br>
Drink up the cocktail&mdash;vanity laced with shame&mdash;<br>
What's one lost breast beside a rescued life? <br>
I've neither God nor my own self to blame, <br>
And I'm&mdash;yes, thankful for the healing knife. <br>
And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;beneath this blousy tunic <br>
I know myself half woman and half eunuch.</p></li>
<li>The afternoon seeps by: asleep, awake,<br>
Propped up by pillows. Writing paper, books, <br>
Glasses of juice proliferate in mixed<br>
Disorder and discomfort. This dull ache<br>
&mdash;Body or soul?&mdash;will pass&mdash;and does it matter? <br>
I rouse myself, put on a record. Still<br>
It makes no difference&mdash;Mozart, Bach, Purcell&mdash;<br>
Not harpsichord nor plaintive reed can shatter <br>
My numbness. Numb, I raise the windowshade. <br>
Sunlight flares up among the naked trees. <br>
My neighbor's trash cans, adamantine, blaze <br>
And opal-breasted doves preen in the road. <br>
Wounded&mdash;oh wrenching loveliness of things &mdash;<br>
Glassy indifference, struck and fractured, sings.</p></li>
<li>A traveling show draws up on spangled horses, <br>
Unfurls a starry backdrop, clowns, a supple <br>
Lady sawn in half, a crystal ball,<br>
Then in a flash rolls itself up, vanishes &mdash;<br>
Quick figure-ground reversal that my mind, <br>
Less nimble, can't keep focussed: at each death <br>
The universe unmakes itself. One breath &mdash;<br>
And mountains, oceans, music, every strand <br>
Of intricate connection, time, the stars <br>
Blown out. No one and nothing<br>
To say <em>I. </em>To say <em>You. </em>Faceless mouthing <br>
Emptiness before the first thought was: <br>
Mask to scare a child, names flung like earth <br>
Into an open grave, these words for death.</p></li>
<li>The dog sheds hair less copiously than I.<br>
My broken strands clog hairbrush, sink and shower. <br>
The dead-white, green-flecked pill three times each day <br>
Drains me of youth, of humor, joy, desire. <br>
Hungry, my stomach heaves. I've learned to shun <br>
Old favorites&mdash;garlic, oatmeal, wine and bread. <br>
A walk around the block&mdash;I'm ready for bed. <br>
My daughter hugs me and we weep. My son <br>
Stretches beside me on the counterpane. <br>
&quot;And do you swear&quot; his eyes bore into mine <br>
&quot;That every single last malignant cell<br>
Will disappear if you just take your pill?&quot; <br>
If I am perjured&mdash;may the angels prove <br>
I did it in good faith, and out of love.</p></li>
<li>What is this death? Come, let me face it down. <br>
Shall I compare thee to&mdash;to what? To sleep? <br>
Unfeeling rock and water? Or the deep <br>
Oblivion of anesthesia? When<br>
The stars were born it was from nothingness&mdash;<br>
Or is what we call void the primal Self<br>
That some have named God and some nothingness? <br>
Our life and death, each one a yin-yang half <br>
Spin in that matrix like a ball in air.<br>
Our atoms and the stars' are the same stuff.<br>
When we praise, wonder, tremble, rage and laugh <br>
The universe knows itself in joy and terror.<br>
Flung forth, combined and scattered, nothing's lost <br>
&mdash;What choice is there but close my eyes, and trust?</p></li>
<li>Twelve months have passed. Has the time come, for me <br>
To write the epilogue? How one September <br>
Day I looked about me at the somber <br>
Golds and bronzes&mdash;realized I was free? <br>
I stretch after sound sleep. No painful, hard <br>
Stitches cramp my arm. No innocent smells <br>
&mdash;Rice cooking&mdash;make me retch. I can walk miles. <br>
And I can lie beside you&mdash;naked, scarred. <br>
Inside I'm&mdash;just the same? No. A deep cave <br>
Where subterranean streams cut winding grooves, <br>
And grave and sacred beasts on ocher hoofs <br>
Circle, and emerald sparkles in the nave, <br>
By chance discovered, lures me on to plumb<br>
These depths. Our life. What's been, and what's to come.</p></li>
