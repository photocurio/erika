<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"> <li>The Descent<br>
<p><em>Daedalus in Knossos once contrived</em><br>
<em>A dancing-floor for fair-haired Ariadne.</em></p>
<p>She danced a winding dance<br>
her bare white feet<br>
weaving the pattern of a coiling tune<br>
&mdash; design of serpentine or marble pebbles <br>
set in the floor of any wayside shrine.</p>
<p>Then was the ancient story just a game<br>
the villagers call Troy-town?<br>
What of the passages, the ways,<br>
the branching and dividing and rejoining maze? </p>
<p>She rode the spiral down.<br>
She rode the escalator down,<br>
the polished platform disappeared from view. <br>
Old destinations echoed &mdash; Rome, Berlin, <br>
Bremen, New York &mdash; a thin chant threading <br>
the snailshell cochlea. The air<br>
bore scents of phosphor and of iodine.</p>
<p>She reached ground zero, groped<br>
among the rags, the rubble, the charred leaves <br>
of torn papyrus lettered with old lyrics, <br>
the scattered tesserae and iridescent shards <br>
&mdash; there was a door <br>
it opened on a stairwell going down.</p></li>
<li> Civitas Dei
<p>The princess is rolling a crystal ball, <br>
the princess is spinning a silver top, <br>
is playing hopscotch on the cobbles<br>
beneath the spires and oriels, the gates and crenelations <br>
of her city. Dresden? Berlin? Alexandria <br>
of the Magician, little Innsbruck, Tyre?</p>
<p>It is the city of the god<br>
whatever its name. Where she dwells with her mother <br>
in a spacious apartment in the inner city,<br>
rosy with the gleam of old Bohemian glass.<br>
They sit at the darkly polished table,<br>
the scarred and cracked but shining refectory table<br>
and eat black bread and imitation honey<br>
while the baby plays <br>
while the siren shrieks <br>
while the walls tremble<br>
in the deep booming of the bombardment,<br>
the rat-tat-tat of anti-aircraft fire.<br>
(Surely by this time they are in the basement?)</p>
<p>The linden trees are hung with giant veils <br>
for camouflage. The houses fall and fall <br>
until no camouflage is needed.<br>
In little gardens<br>
cabbages swell and rot beside the dahlias.</p>
<p>The god withdraws.</p>
<p>The princess in disguise flees with her mama, <br>
is taken to live with a pastor's family<br>
beside the village church. (Whose windows tremble <br>
whose dog hides under the bed<br>
when they are flattening the distant city.)<br>
Her crystal ball<br>
rolls down a deep well of forgetting.</p></li>
<li> The Goose-Girl and the Sea
<p>Their clothes were rags. <br>
What did they wear <br>
as war wore on?<br>
A sky-blue silk chemise<br>
that once had been the queen's<br>
is what the goose-girl wore <br>
and loved to wear.<br>
The children all went barefoot.<br>
With tough and dirty feet<br>
they trod upon the stubble, gleaning wheat.</p>
<p>But winter was coming.<br>
They heard a rumor of a shoemaker <br>
still plying his trade in a far town <br>
beside the sea. The two friends begged <br>
and begged to go.</p>
<p>They were given a loaf of bread,<br>
a jug of buttermilk and their gaping shoes <br>
packed in their rucksacks.<br>
The boy and girl danced down the road, <br>
she in her mama's slip<br>
he in his missing father's trousers, cut down. <br>
The road unwound<br>
in unfamiliar swoops and curlicues <br>
drawing them on. Never<br>
had they been so far from home.</p>
<p>The soft dust of the road,<br>
the roadside cornflowers as blue as eyes,<br>
the little goose-blossoms, the dandelion suns, <br>
a high hill, breathless climbing slope,<br>
the crest &mdash;<br>
<span style="padding-left:50px;">before their dazzled eyes</span><br>
a shimmering surprise<br>
blue in the crystal distance where it flowed <br>
to sky. An aquamarine plenitude, a flood <br>
of wordless joy.<br>
At last<br>
one of them breathed: the sea.</p>
<p>Whether they ever came down from that hill <br>
and found the shoemaker<br>
and stumbled home in darkness<br>
she cannot later tell. But still she sees<br>
&mdash; oh sudden prickle of tears behind closed eyes &mdash;<br>
the blue, the pure blue of the living sea.</p></li>
<li>The Retreat
<p>Then Father Zeus proclaimed,<br>
the word came from on high:<br>
Abandon farms and goods and chattels.</p>
<p>Obedient, the matrons<br>
packed up their lares and penates, hid<br>
their rhytons and red-figured sewing machines.</p>
<p>The pastor's family<br>
crammed pigs and geese and silverware <br>
and great-grossmutter's Biedermeier clock</p>
<p>and all their feather beds onto an oxcart <br>
and plodded west. Pious Aeneas<br>
hoisted his aged father on his back.</p>
<p>The oxcarts creaked. The Polish chattels <br>
stood in a silent line along the street <br>
and watched them leave.</p>
<p>The Eastern Front was coming closer,<br>
was bloodily visible and certainly audible, <br>
a nightlong red Walpurgisnacht</p>
<p>against which black midwinter trees <br>
wrung their naked branches<br>
while the earth-shaker roared.</p>
<p>Oxcarts and tanks, the tortoise<br>
and the elephant; and Mama sick<br>
with a bloodpoisoned finger. Streaks of red</p>
<p>ran from the sky along her arm<br>
as she sewed our long-expired American passports <br>
into our sleeves. We begged her not to die.</p>
<p>She lived. We fled the pastor's family,<br>
the household goods, the slow-meandering <br>
doomed and sacrificial ox-procession</p>
<p>and clawed our way in through the windows <br>
of the last train. Were jammed<br>
among the shot and dying youths and striplings</p>
<p>of the Wehrmacht. Shared the stale<br>
black bread from Mama's suitcase, passed <br>
dark station platforms thronged with ghosts</p>
<p>who wailed and held their arms out to us <br>
in vain. The train sped past. Oh fortunate, <br>
who crossed into the country of the saved.</p></li>
<li>Cassandra
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>Your looking makes it visible. </em><br>
<em>Wild flares and gold striations </em><br>
<em>in the sun's eye.</em></p>
<p>My looking makes visible a silver airplane <br>
turning and climbing in a bright blue sky. <br>
A chromium toy shooting real bullets. <br>
We are lying in a ditch.<br>
The train stands on the tracks<br>
with all its doors and windows open. <br>
The locomotive burns.<br>
(Across the stubble-field<br>
a tiny farm house: but all of us<br>
are lying in the ditch, not safe<br>
in a farm house eating bread and milk.) <br>
The silver plane turns and returns. <br>
The locomotive burns.<br>
We cover our heads with our arms <br>
but still I saw and see the silver flash, <br>
the blue and burning February sky.</p></li>
<li>Penelope
<p>Ten years went by.<br>
I polished the glass in other people's houses.<br>
I learned to live on stone soup.<br>
My needle flashed.</p>
<p>I stitched a fallow field with nettles.<br>
I said I will walk naked among them: <br>
Only come.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>Downstairs the suitors are eating breakfast </em><br>
<em>and starting to quarrel.</em></p>
<p>I appliqued an anchor <br>
signifying Hope.</p>
<p>Ten years and no letter.<br>
His handwriting was beautiful in my eyes.<br>
I embroidered a hair shirt with alpha and beta. <br>
He told me once: make Roman capitals <br>
not those Nazi Gothic letters.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>Downstairs the suitors are toasting you, </em><br>
  <em>tossing the glasses into the fireplace.</em></p>
<p>He sold the Bohemian glass<br>
before the Party got their hands on it.<br>
Others were shipwrecked, drowned, were shot or captured. <br>
He slipped through the Eastern Front, elegant<br>
even in a bullet-torn uniform, an amusing disguise. <br>
War left him cold. But Aphrodite<br>
waylaying him beside the icy Baltic &mdash;</p>
<p>Moonrise. Rip out<br>
the nettles the letters A to Z capital and minuscule <br>
the ship the dove-grey amber-bearing sea. Snip <br>
the anchor chain. There.<br>
Let's go see what the suitors are up to.</p></li>
<li>Ariadne
<p>The ball of silk was unwinding as she spoke. <br>
I followed where it led, the compass needle <br>
flashed round and round.</p>
<p>She knotted the thread. They dragged the bull's head out. <br>
Dragged the sea-bed<br>
for the titanic anchor,<br>
and all the youths and maidens<br>
took up their backpacks<br>
and took ship for Naxos.<br>
She threaded the needle with wine-dark silk.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>You were the heroine.</em></p>
<p>Yes, so I was and am.<br>
Naxos &mdash; how beautiful in the blue gulf &mdash;<br>
all sand and palest sandstone, wash of roses. <br>
The roseate nesting terns that fluttered up <br>
like Aphrodite's doves around us,<br>
a little piney woods, and cantharelli<br>
&mdash; gold goblets from the hand of earth.<br>
I was exhausted &mdash; slept on Theseus's shoulder &mdash;<br>
and when I woke &mdash;</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>The black sail dipping on the horizon.</em></p>
<p>Alone I abandoned myself to grief, <br>
an abandoned woman. I writhed <br>
upon the sand, I gnawed my hair. <br>
I wept until grief turned to fury.<br>
When the sun<br>
began to set I saw that I had better <br>
prepare for a long stay. They'd left me <br>
three matches and a tarp. In time <br>
I had a blazing driftwood fire, <br>
and chanterelles and mussels sizzled <br>
in a tin can I'd found.<br>
I wrote it all down in my journal.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>Tell about the god.</em></p>
<p> <span style="padding-left:30px;">Coming toward me through an azure</span> <br>
sky? Clothed in light? With silver wings that beat <br>
the halcyon-dazzled air?</p>
<p>She bit the thread. <br>
Night fell.</p></li>
<li>Dream
<p>where I lived with many others, <br>
my separate selves.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>A labyrinth?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps. There was one <em>&mdash;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>a god</em></p>
<p>who watched me. Wanted <br>
and desired me. I left. He <br>
followed. I did flee, became</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>a reed, a flower, a tree.</em></p>
<p>He hunted me,<br>
shut me up in an earthen room <br>
whose walls kept shrinking. Waved <br>
a budding oak branch over me. <br>
I closed my eyes and saw</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>a tiny door?</em></p>
<p>I crept out through that door</p>
<p>to the underside of the world. A flat plain <br>
before dawn, a wispy cloudland<br>
trailing mist, where shrouded trees like storks <br>
nodded and swayed together.<br>
There was no other in this empty, pale&shy;<br>
before-the-sunrise landscape.<br>
I started to walk home.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>My heart began to pound &mdash;</em><br>
<span style="padding-left:10px;"><em>I'd caught a glimpse &mdash;</em></span></p>
<p>&mdash; my back was turned &mdash;<br>
tell what you saw.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>The mist rolled back in patches.</em><br>
<em>A band of crones and sorcerers</em><br>
<em>wearing beaks and plumes and antlers </em><br>
<em>was stalking you.</em></p>
<p>Then &mdash; my pursuer?</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"><em>Raised his bow. </em><br>
    <em>The arrow flew. </em><br>
    <em>You dropped.</em></p></li>
<li>Cassandra
<p>The sad woman then spoke<br>
lifting her face from her hands<br>
so that her black hair tumbled down</p>
<p>(she was a madwoman in real <br>
that is in former life &mdash; or so<br>
I seemed in waking to remember)</p>
<p>and though I could not understand<br>
the words of what she said, I knew she felt;<br>
I felt her feelings. Oh! It was my former language</p>
<p>she fluently or trippingly did utter. <br>
(The stuttering spokes of oxcart wheels <br>
that rattled without tires over the cobbles</p>
<p>in what was formerly the fatherland <br>
but before that Poland which it is <br>
now formally, if briefly.) The sexton</p>
<p>is even now digging the former city <br>
up with his spade because the trapped <br>
survivors are calling from the cellar</p>
<p>buried in the black hold of &mdash; a freighter? <br>
And of the anchor &mdash; speak, alter echo. <br>
Hail, great bull's head.</p>
<p>The god.<br>
The silver horns.<br>
The bearded anchor chain.</p>
<p>But I rattle on. There were survivors. <br>
Did they but all alone bewail their state? <br>
They didn't. They took picks &amp; mattocks</p>
<p>&amp; sticks &amp; all manner of tools<br>
and hacked a tunnel through the bricks <br>
beneath the Styx beneath their</p>
<p>former city's battlements that lay <br>
in ruins &mdash; all, all in ruins.<br>
Was nothing of them found?</p>
<p>Oh certainly &mdash; some runes that ran <br>
about the place of execution<br>
in strict formation, though the capitals</p>
<p>were not those Nazi ugly Gothics but <br>
upstanding Roman letters. More anon. <br>
Burn this &mdash; anonymous. A landscape by</p>
<p>Hieronymus the Boche was what<br>
so baffled &mdash; no battered &mdash; the imagination <br>
of this future dreamer.</p>
<p>Unwind the ball of thread.<br>
What color have we come to?<br>
Orange to red to blood-red went the sky.</p>
<p>It was the burning villages we saw,<br>
the pillaged villages they set afire<br>
whose names were stricken from our tongues</p>
<p>as from the map, too. Our one long<br>
muddy street stippled with deep familiar prints <br>
of oxen. Flights of pigeons from the belfry</p>
<p>that wicked boys did wring the necks and strip <br>
for pigeon pies. Not wicked. Famished. <br>
Grandmother on her feather bed</p>
<p>in the oxcart. The horizon blazed.<br>
That noise is just machine guns,<br>
still distant. But my coat, at least, <em>was </em>warm</p>
<p>especially with all those skirts and sweaters <br>
under it. I wore my rucksack<br>
and held my little brother's hand</p>
<p>and Mama held the suitcase<br>
filled with bread. The gentle swaying<br>
of the tumbrils. <em>Tumblehome, </em>a term</p>
<p>for a particular curve a ship can take. <br>
The freighter took me home,<br>
I tumbled into sleep. Or stumbled</p>
<p>into the New World. Ate<br>
my first American candy bar <br>
and learned to read in English,</p>
<p>the mother tongue. Some words<br>
were the same: <em>Brief, </em>a letter. Also brief <br>
as in a short letter.</p>
<p>He wrote no letter. I became<br>
an innocent child. You, Selfsame One, <br>
grew up to have dark hair (but I am blond</p>
<p>&mdash; grey now to tell the truth)<br>
and speak in tongues.<br>
And you no longer answer to my name.</p></li>
<li>Ariadne: the Prophesy
<p>That she would come to Delos.<br>
That the sea<br>
would foam around her sandals, harmlessly.</p>
<p>Of roses, crinkled, salt-stung, garlanding<br>
a granite shore,<br>
the driftwood-strewn, the dulse-embroidered strand.</p>
<p>And of the god</p>
<p>an altar-stone among the mossy roots. <br>
Horns of a stag beside an altar-stone. <br>
Herm of a god beside the boundary-stone.</p>
<p>The dance he taught <br>
the dance she learned</p>
<p>and still is danced and still the song is heard.<br>
</p></li>
</ol>
