<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
<li>Some ladies in Boston raised the twenty pounds. <br>
How had she fared among the savages<br>
they asked. She'd sewn a shirt<br>
for her captor's little son<br>
from a new pillowslip of Holland lace<br>
they'd stripped off her own bed before they burned it. <br>
For that he gave her six roast ground-nuts<br>
and a small bloody piece of horse's liver<br>
which she gulped raw. <strong>Never had I bit<br>
so savoury&hellip;</strong></li>

<li>Rehearsed and never quite believed in<br>
that moment when the curtain dimity, velvet<br>
(the face of terror) slashed naked<br>
the cloak now avails<br>
before the scouring wind of His permission <br>
demonic gashes of black paint<br>
she faces the masks<br>
she masks her terror even even when <br>
husband on your return oh even now<br>
riding turn turn back<br>
(the trestle table overturned<br>
and pewter rolling in the deathly silence<br>
after the screaming is stilled.)<br>
<br>
And all along she knew<br>
about this open savage world<br>
where bear wolf fox<br>
but oh, even here God&rsquo;s mercy<br>
surmounting man&rsquo;s cruelty<br>
&mdash;was that an owl that hooted in broad day? <br>
So close? A fox that barked? An axe <br>
there in the doorway.<br>
Now she is in some inner circle<br>
of hell. They slashed right through <br>
her ordered spheres. <strong>I bore this<br>
as well as I could</strong> she glances up <br>
into the deepening cup of blue<br>
that has its center surely still in Him? <br>
If she could find her way &mdash;<br>
<br>
stumbling through woods &mdash; a fallen birch &mdash; <br>
somehow climbs over it with torn hands, <br>
ripped skirt &mdash; blood on her arms &mdash; the baby?<br> 
He is carrying it, the same who &mdash;<br>
Was it just this morning? Was it just?<br>
Was it God's punishment? This morning<br>
has no beginning &mdash; she has from eternity<br>
been stumbling through the forest.<br>
The wilderness has sent its spirits<br>
to fetch her &mdash; but what of the Lord's Holy Spirit? <br>
You are not touched nor injured.<br>
<strong>There was no resisting&hellip;</strong><br>
<br>
Splashing through swamps beyond the known world. <br>
How many miles guarded, impenetrable, by alders? <br>
Terra incognita. Her terror<br>
somewhat abates. Ebbs toward exhaustion.<br>
He, burdened with spoils, still carries<br> 
her new-born baby. Leads her<br>
<strong>which I took to be a favour from him</strong> <br>
by the hand through streams.<br>
She murmurs to her older daughters,<br>
lifts her small Eben over mossy logs,<br>
treads brambles underfoot. <strong>Not daring<br>
to appear troubled or show much uneasiness lest &mdash;</strong><br>
</li>

<li><strong>At the side of the river<br>
the Indians would have my oldest daughter <br>
sing them a song.<br>
Then was brought to my remembrance the psalm,<br>
&ldquo;By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down,<br>
yea we wept when we remembered Zion.&rdquo; And my heart <br>
was very full of trouble.</strong><br>
<br>
He scowls, impatient.<br>
&ldquo;Now then! Red Otter, powerful river-woman, <br>
you have come to listen. Quickly<br>
you have arisen. You will carry me across,<br>
you will take me to the far bank,<br>
you walk strongly through the current,<br>
you play in the cold waters,<br>
you have come to listen. Sharply!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His song steadying the water,<br>
his friends each greeting the river.<br>
But the captives &mdash; who will teach them, <br>
ignorant and rude? &ldquo;Sing!<br>
Sing the white man's greeting.<br>
Or River-woman will drown you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<strong>&ldquo;For they that carried us away captive <br>
required of us a song&rdquo;</strong><br>
<br>
Up to their necks in the river,<br>
&ldquo;oh spare&rdquo; &mdash; and the boy on his shoulders <br>
yea, the Red Sea did part for them<br>
and if I put one foot before the other &mdash;<br>
the rocks slippery as glass &mdash; my baby<br>
rest safe against my shoulder &mdash;<br>
&ldquo;Sarah &mdash; your sister's hand&rdquo;<br>
careful &mdash; the water's gentle &mdash; so.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Red Otter this woman and her young <br>
have a white spirit,<br>
you are hearing of it, you are listening, <br>
they are crossing the water,<br>
their spirit greets you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
After the river, mountains &mdash;<br>
breathless clinging to granite spurs,<br>
her flesh still tremulous from childbed<br>
and craving rest &mdash; and Eben starting up in terror <br>
each night. She tries to hold<br>
some picture &mdash; a map &mdash; in her head,<br>
looks back &mdash; pebbles<br>
agleam in moonlight, marking the trail?<br>
<br>
Is there a way back?<br>
Does God still see her plainly,<br>
lost among the endless trees? (In his sleep <br>
Eben cried out &ldquo;Papa! Papa&rdquo;!)<br>
Oh, riding after them! Blot out<br>
the image swimming before her eyes<br>
&mdash; he, arrived home, quickly surrounded, clubbed &mdash; <br>
Dear Lord! He lives. Though she<br>
as in a nightmare, works her laboring way<br>
further and further from his reach.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Having by this time<br>
got considerably on the way &mdash;</strong> groping <br>
through blaze of autumn maples,<br>
notes the wild loveliness, as one might say <br>
one and one makes two.<br>
<br>
Mercifully, a halt. Sinks down,<br>
unbuttons her bodice for the suckling child <br>
while her own stomach gripes with hunger, <br>
<strong>having at times nothing to eat<br>
but pieces of old beaverskin coats<br>
used more for food than raiment.</strong><br>
&ldquo;Sarah, help Eben, he would search,<br>
poor mite, for cranberries.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Indians are at some distance,<br>
talking. Low voices, angular gestures &mdash;<br>
she shivers, watches<br>
with downcast lids. &ldquo;Mary, you have learned <br>
some words, what&rdquo; &mdash; do not meet their eyes. <br>
<strong>Having got considerably on the way,<br>
the Indians parted, and we<br>
must be divided amongst them.<br>
This was a sore grief to us all.</strong><br>
<br>
The short one with thick braids<br>
is coming toward them<br>
takes Sarah by the hand, points<br>
toward the Western hills. &ldquo;Mama?&rdquo;<br>
Throat dry, eyes frantic from one to the other, <br>
leaps &mdash; &ldquo;my Sarah!&rdquo; &mdash; to her feet, the baby <br>
put down in haste. Holds her, will not<br>
be moved, not let her go, face<br>
pressed into her shoulder &mdash; &ldquo;child&rdquo; &mdash; <br>
<strong>My eldest daughter was first taken away.<br>
<br>
We did not travel far<br>
before they took my second daughter from me, <br>
I having now<br>
only my babe at the breast<br>
and little boy six years old.</strong><br>
</li>
<li>He watches, awake in the deep forest &mdash; <br>
Union-of-Rivers and Bear, those shining ones, <br>
skunk-tree sisters talking all night long.<br>
They say frost, they whisper<br>
far, alone. Mooneye. Wind from good hunting. <br>
Answer-stone in his right hand.<br>
Owl pipe shares his breath, smoke<br>
blown in the four directions.<br>
<br>
Brings-me-luck sleeps.<br>
White like death yet lives,<br>
hair like sacred pollen &mdash; <br>
Brings-me-luck. Awiyah, antlered one <br>
see she brings no misfortune to me.<br>
<br>
Best he kills them? A white trail<br>
where sickness walks? A notch in the circle <br>
where good luck streams in for him.<br>
The axe lies alive at his side but<br>
it is no, it is sleeping &mdash; she sleeps, moans, <br>
little Hold-tight curled against her.<br>
Coins like grains of corn<br>
will flow into his hand<br>
from his captives. Ha, the forest people.<br>
Old woman birch has never seen<br>
such ones &mdash; white bark like hers &mdash;<br>
do not belong here.<br>
Belong to him. We will pass through quickly. <br>
Soon snow will fill our footprints.<br>
<br>
<strong>At night I was both wet and tired exceedingly, <br>
lying on the cold ground<br>
in the open woods.</strong><br>
</li>
<li>Bone-weary, one foot before the other,<br>
<strong>Our shoes and stockings being done<br>
and our clothes worn out in that long journey<br>
and the weather coming in very hard</strong> &mdash; little Eben <br>
drags at her skirt until she feels<br>
she walks for both, and when he stumbles<br>
she falls, bruising her knee.<br>
She feels the blood<br>
drain from her face. Prays she has not<br>
been noticed.<br>
<br>
A memory haunts her: she, a young wife,<br>
in Deerfield with her husband on his business. <br>
The great Mr. Williams is to preach that day. <br>
She is afraid to ask, they being Quakers,<br>
if she might hear the famous minister, <br>
captured by Indians and newly freed<br>
by the grace of God. And lo, the Lord <br>
(foreknowing her future need)<br>
moves John to grant her wish before she asks.<br>
<br>
To know that others have walked this trail,<br>
have suffered like her, have won through to redemption<br>
&mdash; it strengthens her, hope surges through her body.<br>
I will survive, according to thy will, I and my children.<br>
<br>
And suddenly she aches with wanting.<br>
To feel John's arms around her one more time.<br>
</li>

<li>By a sweet stream, a clearing.<br>
Corn-hills, familiar, a dear sight<br>
beside the wigwams strewn like woody baskets <br>
among the birches &mdash; <strong>a kind of little shelter <br>
made with the rinds of trees.</strong><br>
<br>
How still the women &mdash; their dark eyes <br>
not unkind? Watchful. She too. Eben <br>
behind her skirt, peeps out<br>
at her master's little naked boy.<br>
Dare she sit down?<br>
<br>
She starts, chokes back a scream &mdash;<br>
at the clearing's edge,<br>
a band of painted savages, a din<br>
like hail or a whole nest of rattlesnakes &mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He has returned with gifts.<br>
Bear made his heart fierce.<br>
Wolf was shadow in the forest.<br>
Crow saw keenly, saw the unknown land.<br>
He with his companions approached the hostile place. <br>
Blood was on the enemy's sleeping robe.<br>
Death was on the enemy's hearth.<br>
The work of his axe was they-do-not-rise.<br>
<br>
He has returned<br>
with gifts of beauty.<br>
He does not forget the women<br>
who wait for him.<br>
He does not forget his brothers.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>The Indians welcomed my master home<br>
with dancing, shouting and beating on hollow trees <br>
which, I suppose, in their thoughts<br>
was a kind of thanks to God<br>
put up for their safe return and<br>
good success.</strong><br>
<br>
&ldquo;My husband has brought you,<br>
white woman and your children.<br>
You will share our wigwam and our work.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
They touch her arms, breathe in<br>
her strange, pale scent.<br>
They murmur over the whiteman gifts<br>
&mdash; a great black iron kettle. <br>
Knives that bite through moosehide<br>
as though it were the finest fawnskin, <br>
scarlet wool the captive <br>
woman knows how to fashion into stockings.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My son has brought you to us. <br>
You will share our corn and meat.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<strong>In plentiful time I felt the comfort of it, <br>
having a portion given<br>
for me and my little ones<br>
which was very acceptable. When flesh was scarce<br>
we had the guts and garbage <br>
allowed us. But pinching hunger <br>
makes every bitter thing sweet.</strong><br>
<br>
Her hands are willing. She cuts wood, <br>
gathers nuts and acorns. Fetches water <br>
in a birchbark bucket<br>
cunningly stitched with pine roots. <br>
Spotted Deer minds the baby,<br>
wraps it snug on her own cradle board, <br>
sings Little Partridge, Little Star-eye to it<br>
&mdash; why does Brings-me-luck frown? But the baby <br>
cries, cries &mdash; a thin hunger-wail &mdash;<br>
does she not fear to anger him? He will flare.<br>
<br>
<strong>I was brought so low my milk dried up,<br>
my baby very poor and weak.<br>
I could perceive its bones<br>
from one end of its back to the other.</strong><br>
She fills her mouth with water, dribbles it<br>
down her breast into the baby's mouth.<br>
Are all white women thus helpless? Sees-the-Sun <br>
pounds walnuts for it into paste,<br>
boils them with cornmeal.<br>
<strong>It began to thrive,<br>
which was before more like to die than live.</strong><br>
</li>
<li>Spotted Deer is tickling the baby <br>
pressing her face against its belly.<br>
The baby's spirit has crept into her own, <br>
a small raccoon into a mossy hollow<br>
&mdash; if she could keep it?<br>
Why after Little Feather<br>
have no more come?<br>
<br>
Would he give her the baby?<br>
But Brings-me-luck &mdash; she tries to think <br>
how it was: led from her wigwam<br>
by men in their beautiful, violent paint, <br>
the days and nights in the forest,<br>
her strange, flimsy moccasins<br>
and dress that tears on every branch.<br>
<br>
She has seen Brings-me-luck weep,<br>
and felt shame for her. <br>
But again and again the picture comes &mdash;<br>
Brings-me-luck in her wigwam<br>
sitting on lace instead of furs<br>
and the black kettle bubbling.<br>
She is making cloth with two sticks. <br>
Why is her husband not there?<br>
<br>
She offers her a handful<br>
of her best dyed porcupine quills.<br>
But Brings-me-luck has not been properly taught. <br>
Spotted Deer shows her<br>
how they weave in and out of deerskin,<br>
but her hands refuse to understand.<br>
There are tears in her pale eyes.<br>
<br>
Spotted Deer frowns, thinks<br>
I would not disgrace my lineage like that <br>
and turns back to the baby.<br>
It coos, and the two women's glances meet. <br>
Both are soft with love.<br>
</li>
<li>It is the Lord's day. She has put aside<br>
her master's half-knit stocking. Has permission <br>
to visit the old squaw<br>
whose wigwam skirts the clearing's furthest edge<br>
&mdash; slips past, into the woods,<br>
with Eben at her heels, the boy<br>
as stealthy in his moccasins as any Indian.<br>
<br>
She leans against a rough-barked spruce, <br>
imagines herself at Meeting, wills herself <br>
among the congregation, close beside him<br>
&mdash; dear God, may he be well!<br>
Sarah, Mary &mdash; Holy Spirit, thy grace &mdash;<br>
the blessing of His presence &mdash; her heart lifts &mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mama.&rdquo; Eben holds out<br>
a fan of bronze and crimson leaves.<br>
&ldquo; &mdash; because they killed the sky bear. That's his blood<br>
on the leaves in fall, I saw him<br>
among the stars last night. Little Feather showed me &mdash; &rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jolted out of herself &mdash; &ldquo;child!<br>
What dreadful untruths &mdash; 'tis their heathen tales. <br>
You must not&rdquo; &mdash; only God<br>
can redden these woods, redeem<br>
all fallen nature with His blood,<br>
redeem His captive people &mdash;<br>
<br>
<strong>neither could I ever think<br>
but that our lives would be preserved<br>
by the overruling power of Him<br>
in whom I put my trust both day and night.</strong><br>
</li>
<li><strong>Then it was that the Lord<br>
struck my master with great sickness <br>
and violent pain &mdash;</strong><br>
<br>
He burns with fever, he shivers<br>
&mdash; what creature has sent this thing?<br>
Bear, thick-fur, you are not offended, <br>
the hunters give back your bones, <br>
they are robed in strength,<br>
you feast with the people,<br>
your spirit is not offended.<br>
<br>
Deer, silent suddenly-there,<br>
you wait at the killing place,<br>
the stamping of your hoofs is come-my-brothers, <br>
the people honor your flesh,<br>
your spirit is not offended.<br>
<br>
But black ice fastens upon his bones, <br>
he breathes pain.<br>
Ghost-woman bends and sways <br>
there in the shadows, white <br>
mushrooms gleaming on dead wood<br>
&mdash; each blow he struck<br>
now striking his own skull,<br>
the stick he flung yesterday at her cub <br>
pounding his ribs.<br>
<br>
<strong>My child was much bruised,<br>
and the pain made him pale as death. <br>
I entreated him not to cry &mdash;</strong><br>
<br>
Sees-the-sun puts on her snowshoes, <br>
folds a pair of newly beaded leggings <br>
into her deerskin pouch.<br>
In the next village lives a <em>m'teoulin</em>,<br>
a man of power.<br>
She starts along the barely visible trail.<br>
<br>
Birch girls go beside her<br>
clothed in blue lichen; glimpse<br>
of red-fur, snow birds &mdash;<br>
does the burnt skunk-tree still stand <br>
still put out new green needles<br>
in hunger-moon?<br>
<br>
But her spirit trembles.<br>
May he be well,<br>
may the evil thing leave him &mdash;<br>
may the great dying not return &mdash; death <br>
feasting in every wigwam. Let healing come &mdash;<br>
<br>
She stares. Above the trees, black shape, <br>
fringed wings sweeping the air,<br>
harsh voice &mdash; her birthname, secret self &mdash; <br>
she stands, rooted in stillness, breathes<br>
&ldquo;Grandfather Raven&rdquo; &mdash; fierce dark eye<br>
fastened to hers &mdash; yes, and yes<br>
<br>
gone. Power song pouring <br>
from her throat<br>
there on the snowy trail.<br>
<br>
Wind-fingers streak her face &mdash;<br>
how far has she come? Already<br>
the first meat-drying racks are visible.<br>
She makes a quick prayer to the four directions.<br>
</li>
<li>Beside the sick man, the <em>m'teoulin</em><br>
prepares the plant called when-their-saliva-is-bitter, <br>
sings the chant of driving it out.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Now then! You have come to listen,<br>
Little Whirlwind, wizard!<br>
Among the stretched-out branches of the mountain <br>
You sweep it away<br>
You toss it about<br>
You scatter it<br>
Ha-yi!<br>
<br>
You and I facing each other <br>
Little Whirlwind, wizard! 
You do not fail<br>
You drive it into the marsh <br>
You brush it away.<br>
Healing has been done,<br>
It has been done indeed. Ha-yi!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Tobacco smoke cool cloud <br>
against his forehead,<br>
bitter, healing drink<br>
over his swollen tongue <br>
carrying away the evil thing.<br>
<br>
<strong>He soon recovered,<br>
nor do I remember<br>
he ever after struck me or my children again. <br>
This I took as the Lord's doing,<br>
and it was marvellous in my eyes.</strong><br>
</li>
<li>The circle of the People<br>
is broken, and power streams out of it. <br>
He dreams a moose across the river, <br>
but no moose comes to his gun. <br>
Beaver woman has left her lodge<br>
and taken all her people with her.<br>
<br>
He is shamed. Spotted Deer and Sees-the-Sun <br>
boil an old horse's foot<br>
in the black iron kettle<br>
but the broth gives no strength.<br>
Little Feather<br>
lies curled like a puppy on his deerskin <br>
and will not play<br>
and will not wear his fine new shirt.<br>
<br>
A handful of groundnuts <br>
turns to foul slime in his fist. <br>
Snow hides the sky, the trees <br>
groan with it. At night <br>
Sees-the-sun coughs. Blood <br>
speckles her sleeve.<br>
<br>
<strong>I dreaded his returning empty <br>
and prayed secretly in my heart <br>
that he might catch some food &mdash;</strong><br>
<br>
But he comes back with nothing,<br>
in a rage. His eyes search the wigwam.<br>
&ldquo;Too many bellies to fill&rdquo; &mdash;<br>
stroking his axe. Spotted Deer<br>
turns rigid, glances<br>
at Brings-me-luck shrinking in the shadows. <br>
&ldquo;Ransom would bring us food&rdquo; she murmurs.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Whiteman food! Who knows<br>
if anyone will buy her?<br>
And the journey is long and bitter &mdash; <br>
she will die on the way.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Sees-the-sun stands, faces him<br>
but will not anger him by meeting his eyes. <br>
&ldquo;Brings-me-luck has brought ill fortune to us. <br>
Her white smell frightens the deer.<br>
Her coming and going offends Beaver Woman. <br>
Her son eats Little Feather's food.<br>
But killing her will fasten her spirit<br>
upon our wigwam. Evil<br>
will dwell with us. At last the village<br>
will cast us out.<br>
<br>
My son, it is long<br>
since you summoned the small spotted ones, <br>
the good tribe underground. <br>
Their words have always been true.<br>
Let them help us now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He scowls, but the next night<br>
he builds a little lodge<br>
of saplings. Makes fire. The women <br>
see the branch walls bulge and shake. <br>
They peep between the cracks.<br>
<br>
Fire shines on him. Around the blaze <br>
the salamander tribe with yellow spots <br>
stand upright, flicking their tongues. <br>
He listens.<br>
<br>
<strong>After this he would not suffer me <br>
in his presence.<br>
We made another remove,<br>
it being two day&rsquo;s journey,<br>
and mostly upon the ice.<br>
He took me to the French<br>
and I was with my baby ransomed; <br>
my little boy likewise at the same time <br>
was redeemed also.</strong></li>
</ol>
