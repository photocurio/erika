<p>A few rags tied to branches<br>
led us into the bog. Brown water <br>
seeped over our ankles like tea, <br>
pogonia and arethusa nodded<br>
beside the sudden pools our footsteps made.<br>
Last year's cranberries<br>
held their fermented sweets, <br>
and pitcher plants<br>
thrust up fat vessels filled with dew<br>
where small flies struggled.</p>
<p>At the swamp&rsquo;s edge<br>
an abandoned house still held<br>
preserving jars and mugs, a checkered apron, <br>
and <em>Tropical Lands, </em>mildewed etchings<br>
of crocodiles and monkeys spilling from its spine. <br>
Like children, holding hands, we followed <br>
a trail of rusty nails<br>
to the collapsed floor of the summer kitchen <br>
where woodchucks burrowed. Rhubarb<br>
surrounded the house like a rain forest.</p>
<p>That night<br>
the stew of rhubarb and brown sugar<br>
was tart and sweet on our tongues.<br>
Old woman, I thought,<br>
I would have gone berrying with you,<br>
baskets strapped to our backs, hands free,<br>
tying shreds of an old scarf to hackmatack limbs.<br>
When the cranberries shriveled to wrinkled leather bags, <br>
did you take to your bed<br>
or did you one day<br>
walk deeper into the bog<br>
until it quaked beneath your weight<br>
and pitcher plants grew up around you?</p>
