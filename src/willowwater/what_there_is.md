<p>We heard the surf before we saw it, white<br>
Against blurred gray: a sudden lift,<br>
Muslin brushed aside, and from the mist<br>
An island swam &mdash; still indistinct, just roused <br>
From its cocoon of cloud &mdash; stretched granite arms <br>
And shook an osprey from a spruce tip. Dazed, <br>
We dropped our sails and anchored for the night.</p>
<p>Next day we walked the island's edge<br>
From rock to rounded ledges,<br>
Like playing leap-frog on the backs of whales <br>
That had been beached so long they wore a pelt <br>
Of tawny-pale, crackle-work barnacles.<br>
Are there more barnacles or stars, I asked,<br>
In the world? You laughed and drew me down <br>
To where a sandy crescent curved<br>
Past cream-and-blood-red roses, to the sea.</p>
<p>Then swimming naked in that stinging broth, <br>
That tongue of arctic ocean,<br>
And later, veined with salt<br>
You kissed up from my breast, I felt<br>
The earth's life like a supple skin<br>
Stretched on the bare bones of the universe. <br>
What we call <em>beautiful </em>is what there is.</p>
