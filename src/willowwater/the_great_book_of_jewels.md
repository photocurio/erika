<p>&ldquo;In this example of petrification, the dinosaur bone <br>
has been replaced by agate and the central cavity <br>
filled with amethyst.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-left:12em;"><em>&mdash;The Great Book of Jewels</em></p>
<p>The greenish light that filters through, <br>
Jade-pale, illumines her cold flesh, <br>
Obsidian waters bear her weight,<br>
Their warmth the salty phlegm of lymph. <br>
Her thought is crystal, it commands <br>
Her adamant gaze, her leaden tail, <br>
Her crusted feet that tread the ooze, <br>
Her jaw set with blunt ivories <br>
That grind the garnet-apple's seeds.<br>
Soon she will heave herself through reeds <br>
More sinuous than her jointed spine, <br>
And in the smooth mud of the shore <br>
Lay her translucent, pearly spawn; <br>
Hatchlings bathed in chrism, and fed <br>
Crumb of coal and amber bread: <br>
Blood of her blood, stone of her stone, <br>
Amethyst of her amethyst bone.</p>
