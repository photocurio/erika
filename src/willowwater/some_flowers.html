<p>Your coffin was pine,<br>
a simple fact.<br>
Gravediggers in overalls<br>
brought sturdy shovels, worn <br>
with use and we<br>
stepped forward one by one: <br>
Heft of the handle in my hand. <br>
A spadeful of earth.</p>
<p>On my last letter to the hospital<br>
I printed crazily, <em>please forward.</em><br>
I told myself you might be going home,<br>
knew better, if home<br>
is husband, children, life. <br>
Since we'd not talk again<br>
I wanted to send after you <br>
what perhaps endures.</p>
<p>And <em>I </em>am in transition.<br>
Oh, not immediately. I feel health <br>
like a flushed veneer of rosewood<br>
on sober-sided pine. There will be time <br>
to lay these flowers on your grave, <br>
love-death of peony, delphinium <br>
infinities of sky, midsummer-men <br>
for wishes unfulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;Of earth and starry heaven&quot; you have become <br>
mystery, the breath<br>
beneath the world. No matter how often<br>
I touch the scar still aching<br>
I cannot fear, though for perversity<br>
I try. The rose<br>
opens for me in a continuous <br>
slow motion. Opens <em>in </em>me.</p>
