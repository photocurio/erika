<p>The red-haired fishwoman <br>
chooses for me:<br>
three rascasse, two rougets, <br>
one dorade, shrimps, mussels <br>
and three mean-looking heads <br>
each as big as a fish.</p>
<p>Going home in the train<br>
they soak through the newspaper, <br>
drip from my net<br>
onto the clean train floor.<br>
Their smell trails me home.</p>
<p>Weeping, I slice onions.<br>
The fish make wicked mouths. Spiky, <br>
spiny, glittering with pink and gray scales <br>
they flop under my knife<br>
and prick my thumbs.<br>
The heads regard me<br>
cooking.</p>
<p>The cats from next door<br>
wind themselves yowling around my ankles.<br>
I dare not lift the lid<br>
for fear they will hurl themselves in,<br>
and I remember the story of Gwion<br>
who dipped his finger in the witch's cauldron <br>
licked it, and understood <br>
the speech of beasts.</p>
<p>I'll talk with cats, and heed<br>
the prophesies of fish.<br>
I taste the soup. Tonight we'll eat <br>
a broth as rich as blood,<br>
life-giving as the salty sea<br>
in which our earliest mother<br>
cooks us up.</p>
