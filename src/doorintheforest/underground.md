<p>Oblique<br>
a snake slips by.<br>
Some other life disturbs<br>
my mind, jangles my brain, lives in <br>
my veins.</p>
<p>I creep<br>
beneath a root,<br>
become obscure and small,<br>
wait in the earthy dark, don't move <br>
at all.</p>
<p>Secrets<br>
are spilled at night.<br>
Dark holds fear in the bone.<br>
Love licks beneath thin fur, blood quick, <br>
eyes bright.</p>
<p>Hunger<br>
lives in this dark.<br>
Who'll be when I'm found out,<br>
emptied, sucked from my skin, unmade, <br>
no thing?</p>
<p>What gropes<br>
under the bough?<br>
Taste fur, taste breath, taste paw, <br>
do not come nearer, come nearer, <br>
come now.
