It was still early when we left the road \
sparkling with morning sun\
and took the path that brought us\
to this coast. I remember\
how the mist came down.

Stones huge as ancient gods \
rose up before us\
ringing us round. You stooped \
and picked a small wild orchid. \
We passed through

and came to cliffs,\
upended granite, mist\
boiling, the crash of unseen waves. \
Our lips salty our hair\
streaking our cheeks.

We threw on bird skins,\
long grey feathers\
curving black-tipped wings \
exultant beaks. How the wind \
lifted us to hang in the white air

to swoop among the cliffs \
their jagged teeth their \
perilous updrafts. Our eyes \
piercing the cloud saw starfish \
and succulent sweet urchins.

On a broad ledge we rested. Feathered masks \
dropped down. Caressing beaks\
were lips again.\
We slept\
and woke to sun.
