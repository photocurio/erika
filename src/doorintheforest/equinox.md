Stand there, still<br>
against the flowering elm<br>
the blossoms trailing<br>
like woodsmoke<br>
across the dark branches<br>
and you.

I might never<br>
have marked that first flowering<br>
plain as breadcrumbs, tight<br>
as knots. But you filled<br>
my blue pitcher with elm buds<br>
and they hatched in the window<br>
like sparrows.

Now in the amibiguous light<br>
the honey-brown swarm<br>
blurs your face. Poised<br>
on the edge of winter, Love, turn<br>
to me, it is<br>
spring.

<small>Equinox was [recorded as a song](https://open.spotify.com/track/2I2IrxvHddz5foJROT6xam) by composer Scott Wheeler and vocalist Lorna Windsor.</small>
