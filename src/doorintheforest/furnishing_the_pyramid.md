<p>Your mask in its golden <br>
sarcophagus sleeps<br>
folded in the wings of Isis.</p>
<p>Your servants carved <br>
from the <em>shawabty </em>tree <br>
answer for you.</p>
<p>Your soul<br>
will visit your body <br>
in falcon shape</p>
<p>perching on the ebony table <br>
where feasts of duck<br>
await your hunger.</p>
<p>Selket with outspread arms <br>
guards your brain<br>
your lungs</p>
<p>preserved<br>
in alabaster jars<br>
with balm and spices,</p>
<p>but you rise, lifted <br>
on the cry <em>live!</em><br>
<em>Live forever</em></p>
<p>and move at ease<br>
past this dense barrier, these <br>
things.</p>
