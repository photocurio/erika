**Wicklow Street** ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language"): *Sráid Chill Mhantáin*) is an established shopping street located in [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin "Dublin") city centre, running from [Grafton Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton_Street "Grafton Street") in the east to Exchequer Street and South William Street in the west.

In 1776, the street was part of Exchequer Street, named after the old Exchequer which was sited there, having formerly been known from 1728 as Chequer Lane.
