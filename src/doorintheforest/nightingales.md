You sent postcards from Pisa and Florence, \
I stayed in the suburbs of Paris. I no longer \
bothered to go to the market\
for cheese and mussels and gutted\
rabbits with their\
furry paws and small exposed kidneys.

Afternoons slid into evenings, but it never \
got dark enough for supper. The children \
ate hard-boiled eggs, and I drank\
white wine, sitting on the grass in full \
view of the neighbors.

When night silenced the last \
game of hide and seek\
I got ready, undressing\
in the dark. I opened\
the windows and lay down\
with my face toward the night, \
breathing the cool air, and waiting \
for sleep and for that amorous \
presence to enter our room

like the gleam\
of red gold hair twisted with pearls, \
like veils spun from amethyst, wine \
foaming in a sea shell:\
tï»¿he discourse\
of nightingales.
