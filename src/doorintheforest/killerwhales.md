<p>Climbing bare rock <br>
above the ocean I turn <br>
at your cry.</p>
<p>Three killer whales<br>
moving in close formation <br>
pause, speed by.</p>
<p>We see them wheel<br>
their bodies' dolphin arch, white <br>
over black</p>
<p>from jaw to fluke.<br>
Shamans masked for hunting, they <br>
send cold shock</p>
<p>waves through the air.<br>
The day grows taut, the sea <br>
austere.</p>
