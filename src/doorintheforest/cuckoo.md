<p>The egg I came from<br>
was mottled brown and green<br>
like my false sisters&rsquo;. <br>
Our mother paints them <br>
blue, or stony gray, <br>
whatever matches. But we <br>
hatch first.</p>
<p>Strange, how she gives us<br>
her commands:<br>
as the naked others<br>
flopped beside their broken shells <br>
I got my back up underneath <br>
and heaved them out.</p>
<p>Sometimes she lays us in the nests<br>
of humans: wizened changelings<br>
who cry and cry for food<br>
and never fatten.<br>
But canny foster-parents<br>
boil no more porridge for them<br>
than an egg-shell holds. Until our mother <br>
fetches back her own.</p>
<p>I am well fed, an only child.<br>
My feather cloak is almost finished,<br>
the dark gray primaries,<br>
seductive breast plumes. Already<br>
I do her work: a young husband<br>
hurrying home<br>
through springtime woods, and I<br>
deep in elder blossoms, calling<br>
like a bird.</p>
