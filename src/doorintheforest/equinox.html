<p>Stand there, still<br>
	against the flowering elm <br>
	the blossoms trailing <br>
	like woodsmoke <br>
	accross the dark branches <br>
	and you.</p>

<p>I might never <br>
	have marked that first flowering <br>
	plain as breadcrumbs, tight <br>
	as knots. But you filled <br>
	my blue pitcher with elm buds <br>
	and they hatched in the window <br>
	like sparrows.</p>

<p>Now in the amibiguous light <br>
	the honey-bown swarm <br>
	blurs your face. Poised <br>
	on the edge of winter, Love, turn <br>
	to me, it is <br>
	spring.</p>
