<p>There is a further hidden door to unlock.<br>
The ancient way to it lies through a tangled forest.<br>
The color green is important. No rest, <br>
until she finds the right tree. Its stock<br>
will be of uncommon kind. Not pausing, she'll walk<br>
up to it and embrace it. A kind of test.<br>
Mushrooms will grow from between its roots. The nearest<br> 
door will perhaps be closed by a glacial rock. <br>
Of course this is all guess-work. She <br>
is still looking. Hand shading her face <br>
she stands attentive on the river's shore, <br>
her mind gathered, eyes quick to see. <br>
A willow, shifting, could reveal a space <br>
empty, and the light-filled emptiness beyond the door.</p>
<h2>The Tree</h2>
<p>Preparing to enter the same green space, <br>
tree and woman suffer, exchange, know. <br>
What more? Air parts for both, although <br>
fluid, it interpenetrates all. Their place<br>
is in each other prepared, there is a trace <br>
of sap in her veins already, the overflow<br>
of attentive longing. She has begun to grow <br>
from its roots. Leaves surround her face. <br>
When tree and woman touch and become one, <br>
green wood will speak in tongues of the mind<br>
that, wordless, grows and flowers and branches. See,<br> 
extending threadlike fingers they've begun <br>
to seek their food from earth, and rooted, find <br>
the common life of woman and of tree.</p>
<h2>The Stone</h2>
<p>When she explores the forest it is her own <br>
tangled hair that grows green on a swaying fir. <br>
The salty tidal river is for her<br>
the blood in her veins made manifest, plainly shown<br> 
by the eye's light. A worn, moss-covered stone, <br>
the forest's lodestone, rough granite altar, <br>
attracts circling currents of beast and star <br>
to an archaic ceremony. Walking alone <br>
in her brown body, sweet pine-smelling earth,<br> 
while birds, her senses, dart through summer air, <br>
she seeks that stone hidden in the green, profound <br>
lost center of herself. A new birth<br>
and a blood sacrifice are foretold where <br>
the stone is rolled away, the door is found.
<h2>The River</h2>
<p>The river began by flowing through her night. <br>
Where it was, she was not. She was the shore <br>
it lapped against, she was the sustaining floor <br>
it wore away. At first she tried to fight<br>
against its encroaching. Later the dreamed sight<br> 
of smooth green water filling the door<br>
to her room by night was soothing. She felt it pour<br>
through the cracks it had made in her sleeping body, in bright<br> 
streams. It seemed to her to be rising higher. <br>
Then in broad daylight she noticed her feet were wet.<br> 
A spring had bubbled up from under the ground. <br>
That night, in the heat of mid-summer she slept by fire.<br> 
But listening in her sleep, could not regret <br>
the soft hissing that told her the flame was drowned.
<h2>The Door</h2>
<p>She takes the sky's reflection like a pool. <br>
Soaring on wind she mirrors back a bird. <br>
An echo calls. She tosses it a word.<br>
Her scarecrow wears the motley of the fool.<br> 
Her bones are hollow. Song becomes a tool <br>
to tune a random breath to something heard. <br>
Where two are dancing she will be the third <br>
dancing unseen. The forest is her school. <br>
A tree, she learned the alchemy of green.<br>
In worlds of rock she learned to part and flow.<br> 
Of earth and water, water gave her more. <br>
To will the dark. Abandon all that's been <br>
for what's to come, to be the dark and know<br>
the world flows through her. She's become a door.</p>
