<p style="text-align:center;">The wooded point<br>
the river swirls around<br>
the edge of the forest<br>
its straggling growth of spruce and fir<br>
the deep forest<br>
full of tall light<br>
blue green and jade green shadows<br>
the spring in the tangle<br>
the damp moss the liverworts<br>
the red pine needle floor the roots<br>
the roots in the path<br>
to the shingled house by the river<br>
its round kitchen table<br>
the fireplace made of river rocks<br>
the spiral stair the water washes<br>
over and over<br>
the room of seasoned pine<br>
the double bed with its down quilt<br>
the silence the darkness the cold<br>
stars<br>
your hands your belly<br>
your root</p>
