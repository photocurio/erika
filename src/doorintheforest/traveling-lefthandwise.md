I foretold this journey.
Bundled in wolf skins, sitting together \
in the front of the dogsled.
Our belongings neatly wrapped
and tied up with rawhide. .

Around us the arctic sunset,
the far mountain, the drifting ice \
a giant jigsaw puzzle in the sea. \
And mountain and ice in flames \
crossed with silver, with lead.

I know I should look, that I never \
will see this sight again.
But my eyes are too heavy, my head \
won't lift from your shoulder.
The sled glides on toward the ice.

The sun sinks rapidly lower.
I feel your warmth, your hard body,
its long muscles and ligaments through the fur. \
We will never get off this sled.
I remember I knew.
