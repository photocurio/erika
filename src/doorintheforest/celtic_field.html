<p>Mayday, and fine rain blurs<br>
the small crooked field,<br>
shaggy horned heads, hoot prints in mud, <br>
the new season.</p>
<p>Partway down the field<br>
two standing stones form<br>
a kind of gate, guarding our entry<br>
with carvings worn by centuries of rain. <br>
Hesitants from another age, we trace <br>
the lichen-eaten spirals, half afraid <br>
half hoping to uncoil the spell<br>
trapped at the core.</p>
<p>Oath-bound to this land's goddess<br>
what festival do these grey stones still keep? <br>
Bearded by cowhair, scratching posts <br>
for shaggy flanks,<br>
if they were hung again<br>
with rowan and flowering hawthorn, <br>
circled by dancers to welcome the May, <br>
and there in the grove<br>
lovers</p>
<p>how these old stones would quake, <br>
we would feel the vibrations for miles <br>
down to the sea,<br>
and in the upper air the soft rain <br>
would be gathering.</p>
<p>Cattle have gathered<br>
in a circle around us.<br>
Holding two sticks like horns against your head <br>
you shake them at the cows. They have never <br>
seen anything like it. Spooked,<br>
they back off. And we</p>
<p>running between the stones,<br>
pulled through the field<br>
to the grove, fall<br>
laughing, wet as leaves<br>
in one another's arms. Spring goes <br>
its ancient way.<br>
Cloven hoofprints pattern<br>
the soft ground where we lie.</p>
