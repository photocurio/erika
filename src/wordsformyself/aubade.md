We wake to rain and the river,<br>
peninsulas furred with tender green,<br>
my head on your shoulder in the old way <br>
and the summer house creaking like a boat.

Salt water dripped all night<br>
into my veins, my bones<br>
float in it, washed clean of flesh and blood<br>
and eaten hollow by invisible mouths.

I slide one arm across your chest.<br>
Will we two lie here again?<br>
Sappho, dying, said<br>
tears are unbecoming in a poet's house

but I am smiling
