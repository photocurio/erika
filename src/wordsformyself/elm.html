<p>In the grey light of imminent rain <br>
a tree's in motion at my window: <br>
All day the elm was sinking into me <br>
each branch each leaf<br>
a &quot;colored music in the mind&quot;<br>
continually heard yet never wearied of.</p>
<p>How is it there is, suddenly, so much time <br>
to dwell on the tough, holdfast roots <br>
and leafy crown, its glide and sway, <br>
pause and return, the flow and fall<br>
of every living thing? The self,<br>
transparent and wispy as a breath,<br>
follows the bright green melody<br>
in all its branchings through the lacy web.</p>
<p>Image of God as infinitely small. <br>
The present moment infinitely <br>
magnified.</p>
<p>Vibration near the speed of light. <br>
What subtle intercourse, exchange <br>
of subangelic particles, what feast <br>
then gave me back my self?</p>
<p>Immortal tree&mdash;oh angel of this place, <br>
the music was myself until it ceased..</p>
