_for Daphne_

Daphne, still fleeing, her fingers<br> 
spilling laurel buds<br>
(carved beads of ivory)

Daphne, surrounded<br>
by lilies, surrendered<br>
to meadows of bluebells, Daphne

tall among foxgloves<br>
her wide-brimmed hat. Earth<br> 
under her nails, streaks

of oil-paint-umber, carmine, the true<br> 
azure of delphinium masking her<br>
among foliage and stems.

Bored with vegetables, "when you<br>
could plant flowers," Daphne<br>
not content, never

content with the merely<br>
factual, her lilies<br>
are models for the real, the immortal,

the ever-blooming lilies<br>
that wreathe the faces<br>
of her fierce loves. Daphne

stubborn and rooted,
veined eyelids like petals, brown eyes<br>
meeting the sun's glare<br>

does not allow wilting or fading.<br>
Her passionate brushstrokes <br>
will let no one die.
