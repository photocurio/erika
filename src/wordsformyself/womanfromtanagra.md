<p><em>Statuette in the British Museum</em><br>
<em>Found in a grave near Athens</em></p>
<p>Little coquette from the underworld, <br>
eidolon: draped in the latest Phrygian mode <br>
your chiton's stained with muted <br>
but still gay Aegean blue. <br>
Terracotta curls<br>
combed to a psyche knot under <br>
a wide-brimmed hat&mdash;whom <br>
were you hurrying to meet <br>
when death overtook you?</p>
<p>Restored to light<br>
you draw your cloak<br>
tight around your waist and maiden breasts. <br>
Your rounded arm gleams rosy-brown. <br>
The weight of more than twenty centuries <br>
floats mild as dust in a glass case<br>
on you, smallest immortal.</p>
<p>Caught in mid-gesture, like a finch <br>
glimpsed in a thicket,<br>
you view the fate of blood and breath <br>
with flickering shades of doubt. <br>
But I&mdash;oh in my grave<br>
I want just such a soul<br>
of clay, dressed<br>
to go out.</p>
