<ol>
<li>Green of Late June
<p>The trees bow down, bow<br>
down and dusty weeds<br>
rise up to meet them. The wisteria <br>
along the fence sends greedy tendrils <br>
to snare what passes by<br>
and I, keeping my record,<br>
surprise myself by being here at all.</p>
<p>But is there any other place to be? <br>
America, the world, the universe <br>
&mdash;children addressing letters</p>
<p>The emperor Akbar said<br>
seeing the Valley of Kashmir, <br>
&ldquo;If there is Paradise on earth <br>
it is here, it is here, it is here.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li>White
<p>The nurses wear white pants and flowered shirts, <br>
no longer bound to starchy uniforms,<br>
quaint caps. Friends drift in and out<br>
on their way to the bookstore, the Cape,<br>
wearing new white shorts and blouses. They bring me <br>
the elusive flora and fauna of their&mdash;oh fortunate&mdash;lives.</p></li>
<li>Feet
<p>My feet&mdash;last vanity<br>
two bloated pigs.<br>
Elastic stockings, so tight<br>
my husband has to tug them on. <br>
I, who put polish on my nails <br>
and went barefoot all summer.</p></li>
<li>Present
<p>Is this the same who, every morning <br>
reaches her arms out to her husband, <br>
looks eagerly out the window, and <br>
gives thanks for the enormous present <br>
of another day?</p></li>
</ol>
