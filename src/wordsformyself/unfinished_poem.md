<p>Rise, walk, clutching the walker's rail,<br>
lower myself painfully into the easy chair,<br>
ask for books, writing paper, lunch, in the jail <br>
of myself. Say thank you. Smile. Despair <br>
&mdash;pointless, destructive&mdash;but oh how<br>
not let it well up, hot corrosive, beyond tears, <br>
though I live&mdash;live&mdash;in the present, now&mdash;<br>
sheer fury against the loss of all<br>
that is vivid, swift, spontaneous, the fall <br>
into acceptance, rape, ruin of the years<br>
that should have been&mdash;and pointless to dwell <br>
on&mdash;voracious for immortality, mad&mdash;the cell.</p>
